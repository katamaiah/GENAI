However,  \\nshortages in the availability of certain chips used in critical components like control \\nunits, ABS and infotainment systems, persisted. \\nThe dedicated team at Tata Motors worked tirelessly to address this challenge \\nthrough various mitigation measures. These included swiftly implementing \\nengineering changes to minimise chip dependency, replacing outdated chips with \\nnewer ones, ramping up strategic partnerships with key distributors, developing \\nalternative suppliers, and focusing on localisation. Thanks to these proactive steps, \\nwe could successfully ensure a consistent supply and avoided production delays.\\nFluctuations in demand\\nDuring the second half of FY 2022-23, we observed a gradual normalisation \\nof market demand, reaching levels similar to the pre-COVID period. This was \\ndue to waning of pent up demand.  In addition, the demand for Compressed \\nNatural Gas (CNG) slowed down due to a rise in CNG prices. We implemented \\ntargeted demand-generation strategies to manage customer demand. These \\nencompassed region -specif ic and product-specific marketing campaigns, \\nrestructuring of incentives, the introduction of tailored consumer schemes, and \\nenhancement of the sales process. We prioritised the training of our customer \\nadvocates and equipped them with relevant materials to improve the conversion \\nrate from vehicle bookings to actual sales, ensuring a seamless and effective \\ncustomer journey.\\nOpportunities\\nImproving margins and profitability\\nOver last three years we have deployed a 9 Lever framework for improving margin \\nthrough focused actions around model mix, CRCI (Cost Reduction/ Cost Increase), \\nVAVE (Value Analysis and Value Engineering) , commodity, pricing, fixed cost \\nleverage and non-vehicular business enhancement. In FY 2022-23, we have started \\na focused initiative to cut down market buying of semiconductors to zero and a \\nCapex Excellence program to optimise and sustain Capex, through benchmarking, \\nengineering efficiency, sourcing efficiency and optimal design choices.  These \\ninitiatives have helped the PV business turn profitable and self-sustaining.

SUVs will continue to \\ngarner larger share of the market owing to evolved consumer preference towards \\nSUV.  Post the BSVI Phase 2, most manufacturers have exited the diesel market, \\nhowever, large set of customers are still looking to purchase diesel vehicles owing \\nto its performance. CNG market is set to increase due to government’s push and \\nbenefit of lower operating cost. In addition, EVs will gain traction with increasing \\nacceptance and launch of new models.

This led to acute shortage of raw \\nmaterial and ocean freight containers. \\nTata Motors was seriously affected especially by the shortage of key raw \\nmaterial, Lithium Carbonate, used in Lithium ‑Ion b attery. This shortage led to \\nthe market rate of Lithium Carbonate to rise by over 13X in just one quarter. In \\naddition, non ‑ava ilability of material led to rationing of available stock. \\nWe took various actions to mitigate this risk. In the short term, we devised indexed \\nprice correction mechanism with cell suppliers and shared with them volume \\nprojection with firm quarterly order. This enabled our cell suppliers to better plan \\nand ensure suppliers were in line with demand. Further, we expanded the supply \\ncontract and introduce an additional cell and pack supplier, for our Gen 2 vehicles. \\nOpportunities\\nExpanding the addressable market \\nLimited choices and high price points have hindered the penetration of EVs in the \\nmarket. Despite a remarkable tenfold growth in the EV market over the last three \\nyears, their share in total vehicle sales stands at a mere 1.5% in FY 2022 ‑23. Th e \\nlack of choices at different price points and in body styles, has constrained the \\nwidespread adoption of EVs.\\nWe have the widest range of EV offerings, spanning across three body \\nstyles‑hatchbacks, sedans, and SUVs – which cater to both premium and mass \\nmarket customer segments. As a result, we have achieved an impressive 9% \\npenetration of EVs in our portfolio. \\nGoing forward, we plan to build on this strategic advantage by expanding our \\nEV sales and after ‑sal es network, as well as charging infrastructure across India. \\nWith these initiatives, we are poised to capitalise on the untapped opportunity and \\nexpand our reach to a broader customer base. \\nMaximise localisation to optimise cost and realise incentives  \\nOver the last few years, both central and state governments have launched \\nprogressive EV policies such as Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric \\nVehicles (FAME II) and Production Linked Incentive (PLI) to accelerate the \\nadoption of electric vehicles in the country. However, in order to benefit from \\nthese incentives, OEMs are required to meet the localisation guidelines outlined in \\nthe policies.\\nWe have successfully met all the localisation requirements outlined in the 'Phased \\nManufacturing Plan' (PMP) and 'Domestic Value Add' (DVA) as mandated by FAME \\nand PLI policies. This positions us favourably to unlock incentives that will enhance \\ncost competitiveness.

This combined with \\nefficient borrowings mix and book assignment shall result in \\nimproved net margins for the company\\nControlling Credit Cost: Robust credit assessment \\nmechanisms using market intelligence and data ‑dri ven \\ndecisioning systems have been implemented to evaluate \\nthe creditworthiness of borrowers. Concentrated efforts \\non collection using optimal channels, close monitoring of \\nearly delinquency are being implemented to enhance the \\ncollection efficiency. This coupled with necessary legal \\nintervention and mindful settlement shall result in lower \\ncredit cost for the company.\\nCost Control: Emphasis placed on technology and digital \\ninitiatives to enhance operational efficiency, Customer \\nexperience and better control on the processes shall help \\nin reducing the TAT and improve the overall productivity \\nlevels for the company.

In the recent past, \\nwe have been witnessing increased geo-\\npolitical tensions globally. An increasing \\ndemand for electric vehicles is also \\nleading to price volatility and reduced \\navailability of raw materials within \\nthe supply base.

Steel, \\na principal component for CVs, has \\nwitnessed exponential price increases, \\nbut has stabilised in the current year. Principal risks Consequences Mitigations and opportunities\\nSupply chain disruptions, if not \\nmanaged, could have an adverse \\neffect on production volume, revenue \\nand profitability, customer satisfaction \\nand reputation. Shortage in the supply \\nof semiconductors has continued to \\nimpact our production schedules in \\nFY 2022-23. The Russia -Ukr aine war has \\nhad a significant impact on the global \\neconomy, leading high inflation.

China \\nhas reopened its economy. Supply-chain disruptions are \\nunwinding, while the dislocations to energy and food markets \\ncaused by the war are receding. Simultaneously, the massive \\nand synchronous tightening of monetary policy by most \\ncentral banks has started to tame inflation. Conversely, the \\nrapid rise in interest rates has contributed to stresses in parts \\nof the financial system raising financial stability concerns. The \\nunanticipated failures of two  regional banks in the United \\nStates and the collapse of the Credit Suisse have exerted \\nsignificant pressure on financial markets. The fall in fuel and \\nenergy prices, particularly in the United States, Euro area \\nand Latin America has contributed to the decline in global \\nheadline inflation.\\nCommodities: Primary commodity prices declined 28.2% \\nbetween August 2022 and February 2023. The decrease was \\nled by energy commodities, down 46.4%. \\nCrude Oil : Crude oil prices retreated by 15.7% between August \\n2022 and February 2023 as the slowing global economy \\nweakened demand. European natural gas prices declined by \\n76.1% amid lower consumption and high storage levels. China \\nexperienced its first annual decline in oil consumption in this \\ncentury. Risks of price spikes remain somewhat elevated, \\nhowever, for next winter.\\nMetals:  Base and precious metal prices rebounded by 19.7% \\nand 3.3%, respectively as compared to FY 2021-22. Prices had \\nsurged after the invasion but experienced a broad-based \\nretreat amid slowing Chinese metal demand (accounting \\nfor roughly half of global consumption of major metals) and \\nmonetary policy tightening. With China’s reopening and \\nincreased infrastructure spending the prices rebounded.China:  The lifting of COVID restrictions after many months \\nof lockdown resulted in a surge of COVID infections in the \\nlast quarter of the year which compounded the headwinds \\nfrom property market stresses in China. Declining property \\nsales and real estate investment posed a drag on economic \\nactivity. In January 2023, high frequency economic indicators \\nstarted picking up as COVID-19 waves subsided. \\nUnited States: The US Federal Reserve has been raising \\ninterest rates to restore price stability and to bring balance to \\nthe labor market. The demand for new hires is exceeding the \\nsupply of available workers in the US, as the unemployment \\nrate has fallen to its lowest level in over 50 years, and this has \\ncontributed to higher inflation. To help bring the economy \\nback into balance, IMF analysis shows that staying the course \\nand keeping interest rates elevated this year will tame \\ninflation. Although these higher rates will temporarily increase \\nunemployment, they will pave the way for stable inflation \\nand sustainable economic growth, which will ultimately help \\ncreate more jobs in the future.\\nEurope: GDP is projected to fall to 0.8% in 2023 and 1.4% in \\n2024. Headline inflation is forecasted to fall from 9.2% in 2022 \\nto 6.4% in 2023 and 2.8% in 2024 in the EU. In the euro area, it is \\nprojected to decelerate from 8.4% in 2022 to 5.6% in 2023 and \\nto 2.5% in 2024. The EU economy has seen several positive \\ndevelopments including the fall in the Europe’s main gas \\nbenchmark price to pre-war levels, aided by a sharp fall in \\ngas consumption as well as continued diversification of supply \\nsources. Despite the energy shock the economy managed a \\nbroad stagnation instead of the expected 0.5% contraction. \\nThe unemployment rate remains at its all-time low of 6.1%. \\nHowever, core inflation increased in January and consumers \\nand businesses continue to face high energy costs and with \\nmore than 90% of the core items in the harmonized index of \\nconsumer prices (“HICP”) basket registering above-average \\nprice increases. Domestic demand could turn out higher than \\nprojected, if the recent declines in wholesale gas prices pass \\nthrough to consumer prices more strongly. Risks to inflation \\nremain largely linked to developments in energy markets in \\nthe short run, but upside risks dominate in the outer quarters, \\nas a still tight labor market could result in stronger than \\nanticipated wage pressure.\\nUnited Kingdom: Following a contraction of 0.4% in 2023, \\nGDP is projected to increase by 0.2% in 2024. Consumer \\nprice inflation will peak at around 10% in late 2023 due to \\nhigh energy prices and continuing labor and goods supply \\nshortages, before gradually declining to 2.7% by the end \\nof 2024.

Jaguar \\nvehicles compete primarily against other European brands \\nsuch as Audi, Porsche, BMW and Mercedes Benz as well as \\nTesla. Land Rover and Range Rover vehicles compete largely \\nagainst SUVs from companies such as Audi, BMW, Infiniti, \\nLexus, Mercedes Benz, Porsche, Volvo and Volkswagen.\\nJaguar Land Rover — Seasonality \\nJaguar Land Rover volumes are impacted by the biannual \\nchange in age related registration plates of vehicles in the \\nUnited Kingdom, where new age-related plate registrations \\ntake effect in March and September each year. This has \\nan impact on the resale value of the vehicles because sales \\nare clustered around the time of the year when the vehicle \\nregistration number change occurs. Seasonality in most \\nother markets is driven by the introduction of new model year \\nvehicles and derivatives. Furthermore, Western European \\nmarkets tend to be impacted by summer and winter \\nholidays, and the Chinese market tends to be affected by \\nthe Lunar New Year holiday in either January or February, \\nthe PRC National Day holiday, and the Golden Week holiday \\nin October.

Critical Accounting Policies \\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with \\nInd AS requires management to make judgments, estimates \\nand assumptions that affect the application of accounting \\npolicies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, \\nincome, expenses and disclosures of contingent assets and \\nliabilities as of the date of this annual report and the reported \\namounts of revenues and expenses for the years presented. \\nThe actual results may differ from these estimates. \\nEstimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an \\nongoing basis and on each balance sheet date. Revisions to \\naccounting estimates are recognized in the period in which \\nthe estimate is revised, and future periods are affected. \\nIn particular, information about significant areas of estimation \\nuncertainty and critical judgments in applying accounting \\npolicies that have the most significant effect on the amounts \\nrecognized in the financial statements are included in the \\nfollowing notes: \\nImpairment of Goodwill \\nCGUs to which goodwill is allocated are tested for impairment \\nannually on each balance sheet date, or more frequently \\nwhen there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If \\nthe recoverable amount of the CGU is less than the carrying \\namount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to \\nreduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to that \\nunit and then to the other assets of the unit pro rata on the \\nbasis of carrying amount of each asset in the unit. Goodwill \\nimpairment loss recognized is not reversed in subsequent \\nperiod. Impairment \\nProperty, plants and equipment and intangible assets \\nOn each balance sheet date, we assess whether there is \\nany indication that any property, plants and equipment and \\nintangible assets with finite lives may be impaired. If any \\nsuch impairment exists, the recoverable amount of an asset \\nis estimated to determine the extent of impairment, if any. \\nWhere it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount \\nof an individual asset, we estimate the recoverable amount of \\nthe CGU to which the asset belongs. \\nIntangible assets with indefinite useful lives and intangible \\nassets not yet available for use are tested for impairment \\nannually on each balance sheet date, or earlier if there is an \\nindication that the asset may be impaired. \\nThe recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs \\nto sell and value in use. In assessing VIU, the estimated future \\ncash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-\\ntax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of \\nthe time value of money and the risks specific to the asset \\nfor which the estimates of future cash flows have not been \\nadjusted. \\nIf the recoverable amount of an asset (or CGU) is estimated \\nto be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of \\nthe asset (or CGU) is reduced to its recoverable amount. If this \\noccurs, an impairment loss is recognized immediately in the \\nstatement of profit and loss. \\nFinance receivables \\nWe provide allowances for losses on portfolio of finance \\nreceivables on the basis of expected future collection from \\nreceivables. The future collection is estimated on the basis of \\npast collection trend which are adjusted for changes in current \\ncircumstances as well as expected changes in collection \\nbased on expectations with respect to certain macro-\\neconomic factors, such as GDP growth, fuel price and inflation \\nas well as management judgement regarding qualitative \\nfactors, including economic uncertainty, observable changes \\nin portfolio performance, and other relevant factors. \\nCapitalization of internally generated intangible assets \\nWe undertake significant levels of research and development \\nactivity and for each vehicle program periodic review is \\nundertaken.

In recent years, we \\nand other major automotive companies have experienced \\nconstraints in availability of semiconductors, which has \\nimpacted production volumes. A limited number of companies \\nproduce the majority of semiconductors manufactured \\nglobally. \\nThis concentration of production leaves our supply chains \\nat risk from anything that can impact the production of \\nsemiconductors.\\nThe shortage in the supply of semiconductors has impacted \\nand continued to impact our production schedules in FY 2022-\\n23 and our ability to meet the demand for our vehicles. Such \\nshortages, which affect the entire automotive industry, \\nmay impact us more pronouncedly than our competitors \\nas they may have greater buying power with suppliers or \\nhave a different range of features on their vehicles that are \\ndependent on fewer semiconductors, or we may require \\nmore sophisticated semiconductors which are short in supply, \\nas well as impact our ability to divert the supplies on lower-\\nend models, in which our competitors exclusively operate or \\nfor which our competitors are better able to manage supplies. \\nProduction schedules continue to be actively managed by \\nmanagement in line with the availability of semiconductors and \\nvehicle margin. Along with supply chain uncertainty caused \\nby the COVID-19 pandemic and sudden factory shutdowns \\ndue to natural disasters at major semiconductor production \\nsites worldwide, longer-term trends, such as a general rise \\nin demand in the automotive sector competing with other \\nrapidly growing industries for semiconductor manufacturing \\ncapacity and structural issues within the semiconductor \\nsupplier landscape have complicated our ability to secure \\nsufficient supply. There can be no assurance that we will be \\nable to source for alternative supplies of semiconductors \\nor that such alternative supplies of semiconductors will be \\nreadily available. While we have definitive agreements signed \\nto secure supply of semiconductors for JLR, if we do not get \\nthe supplies as intended, it would impact us significantly.In the event that such shortages continue for a prolonged \\nperiod of time, our production levels may be affected, \\nwhich would materially affect our business and our financial \\ncondition due to poor results of operations. In addition, the \\nshortage of semiconductors could also have an adverse \\nimpact on the implementation of Jaguar Land Rover’s \\nReimagine strategy to expand into EVs, which may contain a \\nhigher level of semiconductors than that used in conventional \\nvehicles. The shortage of semiconductors could also increase \\ncar prices, which could negatively affect customer demand in \\nthe future should other companies be able to increase supply \\nin the future. Furthermore, the extended delivery times of new \\ncars could cause an increase in cancellations by customers. \\nWe have also committed to significant reduction of debt \\nrelated to our automotive operations, excluding the vehicle \\nfinancing segment, by FY 2023-24. As a result of supply chain \\nissues, production was impacted, resulting in adverse working \\ncapital, as a result of which debt for automotive business \\nremained at elevated levels in FY 2021-22 and FY 2022-23, \\nthereby posing a challenge to our near zero net auto debt \\ncommitment by FY 2023-24. The same is now deferred to \\nFY 2024-25. If we continue to face significant supply chain \\nissues, our volumes may be impacted, affecting revenues \\nfrom our operations, profitability, free cash flows and our \\ndebt reduction plans. \\nWhile we expect semiconductor supply to continue to \\ngradually improve throughout FY 2023-24, there is no \\nassurance that this will be the case. \\nWhile we continue to take measures to partially mitigate \\nthe impact of semiconductor supply shortages, including \\nengaging in discussions with leading component suppliers \\nand chip producers, having agreements with critical suppliers \\nfor high-risk chips and prioritizing the production of higher-\\nmargin vehicles, there can be no assurance that such \\nmeasures will provide significant mitigation.

At \\na local level, we rely on smaller enterprises where the risk \\nof insolvency is greater. In addition, for some parts and \\ncomponents, we are dependent on a single source of supply. \\nOur ability to procure supplies in a cost-effective and timely \\nmanner or at all is subject to various factors, some of which \\nare not within our control. Furthermore, there is a risk that \\nmanufacturing capacity does not match to the sales demand, \\nthereby compromising our business performance. Given the \\ntime frames and investments required for any adjustment to \\nthe supply chain, there is no near-term remedy for such a risk. \\nWhile we manage our supply chain as part of our supplier \\nmanagement process, any significant problems or shortages \\nof essential raw materials in the future could adversely affect \\nour results of operations. \\nAdverse economic conditions and declines in vehicle sales \\nhave had a significant financial impact on our suppliers in the \\npast. In addition, our supply chains have been, and continue \\nto be, impacted by business disruptions and uncertainty \\ncaused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

In addition, if one or more of the \\nother global automotive component manufacturers were to \\nbecome insolvent, this would have an adverse impact on the \\nsupply chains and may further adversely affect our results of \\noperations. We are also exposed to supply chain risks relating \\nto the availability of lithium-ion battery cells, which are critical \\nfor EV production. Any disruption to the supply of battery \\ncells or constraints in availability could disrupt production of \\nour vehicles and delay the rollout of our strategic initiatives, \\nincluding Jaguar Land Rover’s Reimagine strategy. As we and \\nother automotive manufacturers expand production of EVs \\nand demand for EVs increases, such risks are heightened. \\nMoreover, we have entered into agreements for the purchase \\nof components from certain suppliers pursuant to which, if \\nwe procure lower quantities than committed, we may have \\nto record provisions toward such contracts, which may have \\na material adverse impact on our financial condition and \\nresults of operations. Deterioration or uncertainty in global economic \\nconditions could have a material adverse impact \\non our business, sales and results of operations. \\nThe automotive industry could be materially affected by the \\ngeneral economic conditions and developments in India and \\naround the world and investors’ reaction to such conditions \\nand developments. \\nThe automotive industry, in general, is cyclical, and economic \\nslowdowns in recent years have affected the manufacturing \\nsector in India, including the automotive and related \\nindustries. Deterioration of key economic metrics, such as the \\ngrowth rate, interest rates and inflation, reduced availability \\nof competitive financing rates for vehicles, implementation of \\nsignificant environmental and tax policies, work stoppages \\nand increase in freight rates and fuel prices could materially \\nand adversely affect our automotive sales and results of \\noperations. Deterioration in key economic metrics in countries \\nwhere we have sales operations may result in a decrease \\nin demand for our automobiles, which, in turn, will cause \\nautomobile prices and manufacturing capacity utilization \\nrates to fall. \\nWe are a global organization and are therefore vulnerable \\nto shifts in global trade and economic policies and outlook. \\nPolicies that result in countries withdrawing from trade pacts, \\nincreasing protectionism and undermining free trade could \\nsubstantially affect our ability to operate as a global business. \\nAdditionally, negative sentiment toward foreign companies \\namong our overseas customers and employees could \\nadversely affect our sales as well as our ability to hire and \\nretain talented people.

Russia’s invasion, the responses of countries and \\npolitical bodies to Russia’s actions and the potential for wider \\nconflict have contributed to increased market volatility in \\nrecent months, and such volatility may continue or amplify \\nin the future. Moreover, in response to Russia’s actions in \\nUkraine, various countries, including the United States, the \\nUnited Kingdom and European Union members, issued broad \\neconomic sanctions against Russia, including to prohibit \\ncertain trade activity with certain Russian corporate entities, \\nfinancial institutions, officials and other specified persons. \\nIn FY 2021-22, Jaguar Land Rover recorded £43 million in \\nrelation to customer liabilities arising from sanctions imposed \\nagainst Russia by countries, preventing the shipment of \\nvehicles and certain parts to the market. No further provisions \\nwere taken in FY 2022-23. Jaguar Land Rover has, over the \\npast three financial years, earned less than 2.5% of revenue \\non average each year from Russia and Ukraine, but has \\nsuspended vehicle exports to Russia to comply with recent \\nexport restrictions. Throughout FY 2022-23, Jaguar Land \\nRover has continued to import a restricted range of safety-\\nrelated parts into Russia for the repair of vehicles in market \\nin compliance with relevant sanctions and export controls \\nmeasures. \\nThe impact of the conflict on our production volume has been \\nlimited during FY 2022-23 as a result of active management \\nof our parts supply chain. However, we are currently unable \\nto predict with certainty the duration and severity of the \\nconflict between Russia and Ukraine and its ultimate impact on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of \\noperation, as these depend on rapidly evolving and uncertain \\ndevelopments and factors that are beyond our control. \\nMoreover, in FY 2022-23 Russia suspended gas supplies \\nto several European Countries. Also, Russian gas supplies \\nto Germany via the Nord Stream 1 pipeline have stopped \\nindefinitely following economic sanctions and damage \\nto both the Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2 pipelines. \\nEuropean countries have switched to increased use of \\nseaborne liquified natural gas shipments to replace supplies \\nfrom Russia. Should there be any disruption to supplies in the \\nfuture, it would impact us, since we import certain parts from \\nmainland Europe, we may face parts shortages or be unable \\nto run production in our manufacturing facilities based in the \\nUK and Slovakia, which could have a material adverse impact \\non our business. \\nEnergy costs in Europe have risen since the buildup to the \\nstart of the conflict in the Ukraine and during FY 2022-23. \\nThese prices may not fall back to prior levels in the future and \\nthis could impact on the global competitiveness of Europe as \\na manufacturing location compared to countries such as the \\nUnited States who may not rely as much on imports of gas \\nfrom Russia.\\nIn the recent past, we have been witnessing increased \\ngeopolitical tensions globally.

We have already initiated necessary \\nactions in terms of training of people and certification of \\nproduct and processes to mitigate such risk.Increases in commodities and input prices may \\nhave a material adverse effect on our results of \\noperations. \\nWe purchase a wide range of raw materials to enable our \\nproduction operations. In FY 2022-23 and FY 2021-22, the \\nconsumption of raw materials and components aggregates \\nand purchase of products for sale (including changes in \\ninventory) constituted 65.5% and 65.0%, respectively, of our \\nrevenues. Prices of commodity items, such as steel, nonferrous \\nmetals, precious metals, rubber and petroleum products \\nare governed by demand supply fundamentals and hence \\nwe are exposed to price risks arising out of these materials.  \\nFurthermore, we are also exposed to the risk of contractions \\nin supply, and any corresponding increase in the price of rare \\nearth metals we use in the production of vehicle electronics. \\nRare earth metal prices and supply remain uncertain. China, \\nwhich is currently the largest producer of rare earths in the \\nworld, has, in the past, limited the export of rare earths from \\ntime to time. If we are unable to find substitutes for such raw \\nmaterials or pass price increases on to customers by raising \\nprices, or to safeguard the supply of scarce raw materials, our \\nvehicle production, business and results from operations could \\nbe materially affected. There also have been battery pricing \\nfluctuations on account of lithium carbonate commodity \\nprice fluctuation.\\nDomestically, our Commercial Vehicles business was \\nsignificantly impacted by increases in commodity prices, \\nprimarily steel. In FY 2021-22, and for the first half of FY 2022-23, \\nthe increase in steel prices and residual commodity inflation \\nimpacted the profitability of our domestic Commercial \\nVehicles business. While TML’s Commercial Vehicle business \\nhas introduced price increases to mitigate the impact of \\nprice increases and steel prices, which have largely cooled \\noff in second half of FY 2022-23, and certain other corrective \\nactions have been taken, there is no assurance that we will \\nnot be affected by such headwinds in the future. Further, BSVI \\nPhase 2 emission norms are applicable from April 1, 2023.

Tata Motors Limited has been a front-runner in EV adoption in \\nIndia with close to 84% market share in EVs for FY 2022-23. With \\nincreased demand for EVs, favorable government policies, \\nand the creation of charging infrastructure, the EV business \\nspace is gaining good traction. However, we have recently \\nseen some launches by competitors and future product plans \\nin the EV segment. The competitiveness in the EV segment \\nis going to increase significantly. If we are not able to meet \\ncustomer expectations, launch products in a timely manner, \\nor if our competitors provide better product offerings in terms \\nof features, range and cost than we do, this would severely \\naffect our demand and dent our market leadership position.\\nThere is no assurance that we will be able to implement our \\nfuture strategies in a way that will mitigate the effects of \\nincreased competition in the Indian automotive industry. \\nWe are exposed to execution risks relating to our strategic \\npartnerships or risks that the alliances entered into by our \\ncompetitors may offer a better customer experience or \\nprove to be financially more beneficial than ours. \\nIn addition, if our competitors consolidate or enter into \\nother strategic partnerships or joint ventures, they may be \\nable to achieve greater economies of scale. Some of our \\ncompetitors have formed such strategic alliances in recent \\nyears. If our competitors are able to benefit from the cost \\nsavings offered by consolidation or strategic partnerships, \\nour competitiveness could be adversely affected. \\nA significant reliance on key markets by both Tata \\nMotors Limited and Jaguar Land Rover increases \\nthe risk of a negative impact from reduced \\ncustomer demand in those countries. \\nWe rely on certain key markets, including the United Kingdom, \\nChina, North America, India and continental Europe, from \\nwhich we derive a substantial portion of our revenues. A \\ndecline in demand for our vehicles in these major markets \\nmay significantly impact our business, financial condition and \\nresults of operations. In addition, our strategy, which includes \\nnew product launches and expansion into growing markets, \\nmay not be sufficient to mitigate a decrease in demand for \\nour products in mature markets in the future, which could have \\na significant adverse impact on our financial performance. \\nIn addition, Jaguar Land Rover’s Reimagine strategy may \\nnot be sufficient to mitigate a decrease in demand for our \\nproducts in mature markets in the future, which could have a \\nsignificant adverse impact on our financial performance.

Such consumer preferences could \\nmaterially affect our ability to sell premium passenger cars \\nand luxury large or medium-size all-terrain vehicles at current \\nor target volume levels, and could have a material adverse \\neffect on our general business activity, net assets, financial \\nposition and results of operations. \\nConsumer demand trends are affected by a variety of \\nfactors, such as disposable income, brand reputation and \\nenvironmental awareness, which can be difficult to predict \\nand/or control. We may fail to identify trends in customer \\nneeds and tastes in sufficient time to react to these changes \\n(including by adapting our strategy and business plan as \\nnecessary), and our attempts to position our brand and/or \\noptimize our product portfolio to take advantage of market \\ntrends and consumer demand patterns may be ineffective. A \\nmisjudgment in our strategy or delayed recognition of trends \\nand customer needs and tastes in individual markets or other \\nchanges in requirements could lead to a decline in demand, \\nsales and profitability of our products and damage our brand. \\nIt could also lead to significantly unprofitable investments and \\nassociated costs. \\nA shift in consumer demand from SUVs toward compact \\nand mid-size Passenger Cars, whether in response to higher \\nfuel prices or other factors, could adversely affect our \\nprofitability. Conversely, if the trend in consumer preferences \\nfor SUVs holds, we could face increased competition from \\nother carmakers as they adapt to the market and introduce \\ntheir own SUV models, which could materially and adversely \\nimpact our business, financial condition or results of \\noperations. Our operations may also be significantly affected \\nif we fail to develop, or experience delays in our planned rollout \\nof fuel-efficient vehicles and EVs and certain technologies \\nthat reflect changing customer preferences and meet \\nthe specific requirements of government regulations. Our \\ncompetitors may gain significant advantages if they are able \\nto offer products satisfying customer needs or government \\nregulations earlier than we are able to, which could adversely \\naffect our business, prospects, financial condition and results \\nof operations. Further, there is no assurance that our new models will meet \\nour sales expectations, in which case we may be unable to \\nrealize the intended economic benefits of our investments. \\nIn addition, there is a risk that our quality standards can \\nbe maintained only by incurring substantial costs for \\nmonitoring and quality assurance. A decrease in the quality \\nof our vehicles (or public perception of such a decrease) could \\ndamage our image and reputation as a premium automobile \\nmanufacturer and materially affect our business, prospects, \\nfinancial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, \\nnon-traditional market participants and/or unexpected \\ninnovations may disrupt the established business model of \\nthe industry by introducing new technologies, distribution \\nmodels or methods of transportation that we may not be \\nable to adapt to or replicate. \\nThere is also a risk that the capital invested in researching \\nand developing new technologies, including autonomous, \\nconnected and electrification technologies, or the capital \\ninvested in mobility solutions to overcome and address future \\ntravel and transport challenges, will, to a considerable extent, \\nhave been spent in vain, because the technologies developed \\nor the products derived therefrom are unsuccessful in the \\nmarket or exhibit failures that are impracticable or too costly \\nto remedy or because competitors have developed better \\nor less expensive products. It is possible that we could then \\nbe compelled to make new investments in researching and \\ndeveloping other technologies to maintain our existing market \\nshare or to win back the market share lost to competitors. \\nIn addition, product development cycles can be lengthy, and \\nthere is no assurance that new designs, including electric and \\nhydrogen-propelled vehicles will lead to revenues from vehicle \\nsales, or that we will be able to accurately forecast demand \\nfor our vehicles, potentially leading to inefficient use of our \\nproduction capacity.

In February \\n2021, Jaguar Land Rover also announced a shift in focus with \\nthe Reimagine strategy, including the plan to introduce the \\nfirst all-electric Land Rover vehicle in 2024 and a further \\nfive Land Rover models with a full battery electric option by \\n2026. Jaguar also intends to transition to a pure electric only \\nluxury brand from 2025. The Reimagine strategy also targets \\nthe production of more sustainable and fully electric luxury \\nvehicles, including the ambitious goal of having a fully electric \\nfleet of luxury vehicles by the end of the decade and 100% of \\nsales from pure battery EVs by 2036, as well as striving toward \\nachieving Net Zero carbon emissions across its supply chain, \\namong other environmentally driven strategies by 2039. \\nFurther, in April 2023, Jaguar Land Rover also announced \\nthat it is committing investment of £15bn over five years in its \\nindustrial footprint, vehicle programmes, autonomous, AI and \\ndigital technologies and people skills. In October 2021, TML \\nannounced a commitment to invest over US$2 billion over the \\nnext five years to expand its EV business. \\nIn FY 2022-23, we have taken a decisive step to minimize the \\npractice of discounting that has plagued the CV industry.  \\nFrom September onwards, we have taken a decisive step by \\nmoving from a push system to a pull system with clear focus \\non VAHAN registration market share as against practice of \\nofftake market share. This step is expected to have short-\\nterm impact on our market share. This step may bring a major \\nshift to industry with focus on profitability. We have recently \\nannounced further price increases for our Commercial \\nVehicles ahead of BS VI Phase 2 emission norms. Further, \\nthere has been an increase in interest costs as a result of  \\npolicies of Reserve Bank of India (the “RBI”). If the consumers \\nare unable to absorb the price increases or our competitors continue with aggressive discounting and operate at better \\noperating efficiencies, our business, prospects, financial \\ncondition and results of operations could be materially and \\nadversely affected.\\nWe are also expanding our growth in domestic business \\nwith a focus on large-scale fleet contracts. Such large \\ncontracts come with execution risks. For example, if we are \\nunable to comply with various terms of agreement or fulfill \\nthe necessary specifications and timelines, we may incur \\npenalties or sustain reputational damage or our financial \\nperformance and results of operations may be affected. \\nFurther, Tata Motors Limited is also expanding its business \\nthrough mass mobility solutions whereby vehicles are sold \\nthrough an own, maintain and operate model offered at a \\n“per kilometer” rate. A separate business vertical has been \\ncarved out for this business. Such business model requires \\ndeployment of significant investments and contracts are of \\na longer tenure, increasing the risks and balance sheet size.

At various times over the course of FY 2021-22, our \\nIndian and Jaguar Land Rover business witnessed disruptions \\nat manufacturing plants and implemented work-from-home \\nprotocols for employees who were able to work remotely in \\nvarious jurisdictions, including India and the United Kingdom, \\nto ensure public safety and to comply with government \\nguidelines in various geographies. These situations have \\ncaused disruptions to our business and have had negative \\nimpacts on our cash flows. \\nWhile our volumes for the domestic business grew quarter \\nover quarter, recurring waves of infection and restrictive \\nmeasures by governments have continued to have an \\nadverse impact on our results of operations. For example, \\nindustry sales volumes for our passenger segment (buses) in \\nCommercial Vehicles experienced a slow recovery. During FY 2022-23, the lockdowns in China as a part of \\ngovernment’s zero COVID strategy impacted our part \\nsupplies, including semiconductors, and we also witnessed a \\ntemporary decrease in demand of our products in our China \\nmarkets.\\nThere is significant uncertainty surrounding such business \\ndisruptions, as continued cross-border restrictions could \\nadversely affect our supply chains globally. We, like other \\nautomotive manufacturers, have experienced some supply \\nchain disruption due to the COVID-19 pandemic, including \\nthe current global unavailability of semiconductors, which \\nhas impacted our production schedules and the ability to \\nmeet global demand for some of our vehicles. As a result, \\nwe adjusted production schedules for certain vehicles and \\nin certain manufacturing plants.

(a joint \\nventure between Fiat Auto and Crédit Agricole) in major \\nEuropean markets, Chase Auto Finance in the United States \\nand BNP Paribas in several markets across Europe and has \\nsimilar arrangements with local providers in a number of \\nother key markets. Any reduction in the supply of available consumer financing for the purchase of new vehicles or an \\nincrease in the cost thereof would make it more difficult for \\nsome of its customers to purchase its vehicles, which could \\nput JLR under commercial pressure to offer new (or expand \\nexisting) retail or dealer incentives to maintain demand for its \\nvehicles, thereby materially and adversely affecting our sales \\nand results of operations. For example, during the global \\nfinancial crisis, several providers of customer finance reduced \\ntheir supply of consumer financing for the purchase of new \\nvehicles. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, central \\nbanks had taken a more accommodating stance; however, \\nwith looming inflationary concerns, all major central banks \\nhave turned aggressive and there have been significant \\nrise in the interest rates. As market rates for new vehicle \\nfinancing rise, our vehicles could become less affordable \\nor retail consumers may favor less expensive vehicles \\nthat tend to be less profitable for us, adversely affecting \\nour business, prospects, financial condition and results of \\noperations. Additionally, as consumer interest rates increase \\nsubstantially or if financial service providers tighten lending \\nstandards or restrict their lending to certain classes of credit, \\nconsumers may not desire to or be able to obtain financing \\nto purchase or lease our vehicles. An increase in interest \\nrates due to tightening monetary policy or for any other \\nreason would result in increased costs for us to the extent we \\ndecided to absorb the impact of such increase. As a result, a \\nsubstantial increase in consumer interest rates or tightening \\nof lending standards could have a material adverse effect \\non our business, prospects, financial condition and results of \\noperations. \\nFurthermore, Jaguar Land Rover offers residual value \\nguarantees on the purchase of certain leases in some \\nmarkets.

Successful delivery of \\nthe programs and management of credit risk from such \\nexposures significantly influence TTL’s financial performance. \\nWhile TTL has a strong business development strategy for \\nnew energy vehicle companies by focusing  on companies \\nthat have secured funding, some of the startup companies it \\nworks with  may experience issues with their financial health \\nand business continuity. Startup companies may have funding \\ndifficulties, uncertain product roadmaps, ownership changes \\nand an unclear credit history.

The acquiring \\ncompanies may also have their own engineering departments \\nwhich specialize in the services TTL offers. Thus, the acquired \\ncompany would not need to outsource such activities to \\nTTL anymore. Additionally, full vehicle development and \\nturnkey projects generally have fixed contract periods and \\nmay cause a decline or fluctuation in TTL’s revenue if such \\ncontracts are not renewed or are terminated prior to the \\nexpiry of the contracts or are completed or if TTL is unable to \\nacquire other such similar full vehicle development or turnkey \\nprojects. \\nTTL is also expanding its innovative offering in the education \\nspace through its iGetIT platform by upskilling and reskilling \\nin relation to the latest engineering and manufacturing \\ntechnologies to public and private sector academic \\ninstitutions through curriculum development and competency \\ncenter offerings.

In particular, \\nas our vehicles become more technologically advanced, we \\nare subject to risks related to their software and operation, \\nincluding our advanced driver assistance systems automation. \\nWe may be required to expend considerable resources in \\nconnection with product recalls, and these resources typically \\ninclude the cost of the part being replaced and the labor \\nrequired to remove and replace the defective part. \\nIn addition, product recalls can cause our consumers to \\nquestion the safety or reliability of our vehicles, which \\nmay harm our reputation. Any harm to our reputation \\nmay result in a substantial loss of customers. For example, \\nwe commenced remediatory action in connection with \\nthe Takata Corporation’s passenger airbag safety recall \\nannounced in May 2015 in the United States by the National \\nHighway Traffic System Administration (the “NHTSA”). The \\nprovision held at the end of FY 2022-23 with respect to the \\nrecall is GBP40 million.

We have experienced and could in the \\nfuture experience foreign exchange losses on obligations \\ndenominated in foreign currencies in respect of our \\nborrowings and foreign currency assets and liabilities due to \\ncurrency fluctuations. We are exposed to changes in interest \\nrates, as we have both interest-bearing assets (including cash \\nbalances) and interest-bearing liabilities, certain of which \\nbear interest at variable rates (including Jaguar Land Rover’s \\nUS$1 billion term loan facility, the UK Export Finance (“UKEF”) \\nand commercial loan facilities and the United Kingdom fleet \\nfinancing facility), whereas the existing notes bear interest \\nat fixed rates. Although we engage in managing our interest \\nand foreign exchange exposure by asset/liability matching \\nand through the use of financial hedging instruments, such as \\nforward contracts, swap agreements and option contracts, \\nhigher interest rates and a weakening of the Indian rupee \\nagainst major foreign currencies could significantly increase \\nour cost of borrowing. Please see note [41(B)(d)(i) – (b)] to our \\nconsolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this \\nannual report for further detail on our exposure to fluctuations \\nin interest rates. \\nAppropriate hedging lines for the type of risk exposures \\nwe are subject to may not be available at a reasonable \\ncost, particularly during volatile rate movements, or at all. \\nMoreover, there are risks associated with the use of such \\nhedging instruments. While hedging instruments may \\nmitigate our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange \\nrates to a certain extent, we potentially forego benefits that \\nmight result from market fluctuations in currency exposures. \\nThese hedging transactions can also result in substantial \\nlosses, including, without limitation, when a counterparty does not perform its obligations under the applicable \\nhedging arrangement, there are currency fluctuations, \\nthe arrangement is imperfect or ineffective, or our internal \\nhedging policies and procedures are not followed or do not \\nwork as planned. \\nIn addition, because our potential obligations under the \\nfinancial hedging instruments are marked to market, we may \\nexperience quarterly and annual volatility in our operating \\nresults and cash flows attributable to our financial hedging \\nactivities. \\nAny of the above may have a material adverse effect on our \\nfinancial condition, results of operations and liquidity. \\nChanges or uncertainty in respect of LIBOR, \\nIBORs, SONIA and/or SOFR may adversely affect \\nsome of our financing arrangements. \\nOn March 5, 2021, the UK Financial Conduct Authority \\nannounced that all LIBOR settings will either cease to be \\nprovided by any administrator or no longer be representative: \\n(a) immediately after December 31, 2021, in the case of the one-\\nweek and two-month U.S. dollar settings, and (b) immediately \\nafter June 30, 2023, in the case of the remaining U.S. dollar \\nsettings. In addition, among other developments, relevant \\nauthorities are strongly encouraging the transition away \\nfrom Interbank Offered Rates (“IBORs”), such as LIBOR, and \\nhave identified “risk-free rates”, such as SOFR, or SONIA, \\nto eventually take the place of such IBORs as primary \\nbenchmarks. Such risk-free rates, including SOFR, have a \\ndifferent methodology and other important differences from \\nthe IBORs they will eventually replace and currently have little \\nhistorical track record.

However, the scale, scope and nature of the \\nintegration, management or separation required in connection \\nwith such transactions present significant challenges, and \\nwe may be unable to integrate, manage or separate the \\nrelevant subsidiaries, divisions and facilities effectively within \\nour expected schedule. A transaction may not meet our \\nexpectations and the realization of the anticipated benefits \\nmay be blocked, delayed or reduced as a result of numerous \\nfactors, some of which are outside our control. \\nThese corporate opportunities may involve risks, including \\nunforeseen contingent risks or latent business liabilities \\nthat may only become apparent after the transaction is \\ncompleted.

Specifically, with the launch of the Reimagine \\nstrategy in February 2021, Jaguar Land Rover is committed to \\ninvesting significant resources in electric battery technology \\nand vehicles, in order to achieve its goal of Net Zero carbon \\nemissions across its supply chain, products and operations by \\n2039. \\nJaguar Land Rover’s annual total product and other \\ninvestment spending was GBP 2.0 billion in FY 2021-22 and GBP \\n2.4 billion in FY 2022-23. Total product and other investment \\nexpenditure guidance for FY 2023-24 is approximately GBP \\n3.0 billion, with the Refocus program announced under the \\nReimagine strategy expected to continue to maintain the \\nfinancial discipline successfully deployed previously under \\nProject Charge+ and other initiatives. \\nOur total product and other investment spending for domestic \\nbusiness was ` 6,812 crores for FY 2022-23. We have plans to \\nsignificantly step up our capital expenditure for our domestic \\nbusiness, and it is expected to be around ` 8,000  crores \\nin FY 2023-24.

For FY 2023-24, on a consolidated basis, we expect to invest \\naround `38,000 crores in property, plants and equipment and \\nproduct development. We expect our businesses to largely \\nremain self-sustaining, and we aim to fund total product \\nand other investment spending primarily with cash flows \\nfrom operating activities supported by debt capital markets \\nactivities and bank funding, as required. \\nWe are also expanding our growth in domestic business with \\na focus on large-scale fleet contracts. Such large contracts \\ncome with execution risks. If we are unable to comply \\nwith various terms of agreement or fulfill the necessary \\nspecifications and timelines, we may incur penalties; it would \\nadversely damage our reputation and significantly affect our \\nfinancial performance and results of operations. \\nFurther, Tata Motors Limited is also expanding its business \\nthrough mass mobility solutions whereby vehicles are sold \\nthrough an own, maintain and operate model offered at a \\n“per kilometer” rate. A separate business vertical has been \\ncarved out for this business. Such business model requires \\ndeployment of significant investments and contracts are \\nof a longer tenure, increasing the risks and balance sheet \\nsize. If we are unable to find right financing structure for this \\nbusiness or there are delays in collections , or our revenues \\nare not able to cover our costs, it would adversely affect \\nour revenues, profitability and liquidity. The Government of \\nIndia is also setting up ambitious E20 targets to achieve 20% \\nEthanol blending by FY 2024-25. In the course of our business, \\nwe need to make investments to comply with laws and \\nregulations and we may not necessarily be able to recover \\nall these costs. \\nAs we increase our EV sales and penetration, we may also be \\nrequired to undertake sizable investment in EV component \\nrelated ecosystem, in order to secure our supplies and \\nmitigate the risks of rising battery prices. \\nTo give impetus to the “Made in India” project and attract \\ninvestments, the Government of India has announced \\nProduction Linked Incentive (“PLI”) scheme for 13 core \\nsectors, including automotive OEMs and automotive \\ncomponent manufacturers with budgeted outlays of over \\n`25,938 crores, for the automotive sector over the five years \\ncommencing April 2022.

As we consider our strategy, we may over \\ntime increase our focus on the production of EVs, make more \\ninvestments in this area and position ourselves as a leading \\nproducer of EVs. Sales of EVs are hard to predict as consumer \\ndemand may fail to shift in favor of EVs, and this market \\nsegment may remain small relative to the overall market for \\nyears to come.

The geo political tensions \\nand rising energy costs as a result of supply issues in Europe, \\nvolatility in economic conditions across our key markets and \\ninflationary scenario may have an impact on consumers \\nbuying power. A decrease in potential customers’ disposable \\nincome or financial flexibility, reductions in the availability of \\nconsumer financing or used car valuations or an increase in \\nthe cost of financing may have a negative impact on demand \\nfor our products. A weak macroeconomic environment, \\ncombined with restrictive lending and a low level of consumer \\nsentiment generally, may reduce consumers’ net purchasing \\npower and lead existing and potential customers to refrain \\nfrom purchasing new vehicles, defer a purchase further \\nor purchase a smaller model with less equipment at a \\nlower price. See “—Deterioration or uncertainty in global \\neconomic conditions could have a material adverse impact \\non our business, sales and results of operations” for more \\ninformation. A deteriorating macroeconomic environment \\nmay disproportionately reduce demand for luxury vehicles. \\nIt also could lead to reluctance by corporate customers to \\ninvest in vehicles for commercial use and/or to lease vehicles, \\nresulting in a postponement of fleet renewal contracts. \\nIn recent years, the automotive industry has increasingly \\noffered customers and dealers price reductions on vehicles \\nand services to stimulate demand for vehicles, which has led \\nto increased price cost of sales pressures and sharpened \\ncompetition within the industry. Any of the above may have \\na material adverse effect on our revenue, financial condition \\nand results of operations. We may be adversely affected by labor unrest. \\nAll of our permanent employees in India, other than officers \\nand managers, and most of our permanent employees in our \\nautomotive business in South Korea and the United Kingdom, \\nincluding certain officers and managers, are members of \\nlabor unions and are covered by our wage agreements, \\nwhere applicable, with those labor unions. \\nIn general, we consider our labor relations with all of our \\nemployees to be good. However, in the future we may be \\nsubject to labor unrest, which may delay or disrupt our \\noperations in the affected regions, including impacting the \\nacquisition of raw materials and parts, the manufacture, sales \\nand distribution of products and the provision of services. If \\nwork stoppages or lock-outs at our facilities or at the facilities \\nof our major vendors occur or continue for a long period of \\ntime, our business, prospects, financial condition and results \\nof operations may be materially and adversely affected. \\nFor example, during FY 2017-18, we faced two stand-alone \\nincidents of labor unrest in India, one at our Jamshedpur plant \\nand the other at our Sanand plant. Although these particular \\nissues were amicably resolved, there is no assurance that \\nadditional labor issues could not occur, or that any future \\nlabor issues will be amicably resolved. \\nIn addition, Jaguar Land Rover engages in wage negotiations \\nin relation to wage agreements covering approximately 75% of \\nour employees in the United Kingdom, and a new agreement \\nwith the United Kingdom trade union was completed in June \\n2021 and agreed upon for two years. There is a risk, however, \\nthat future negotiations could escalate into industrial action \\nranging from “work to rule” to a strike before a settlement is \\nultimately reached.

These include: (i)  leveraging government-\\napproved training schemes, including NAPS, NEEM, Trade \\nApprentice and others, which enables us to engage trainees \\nfor defined period and contribute to government plans to \\neducate and provide skills to youth in India, (ii) leveraging \\nautomation, (iii) work content reduction, and other measures. \\nOur business and prospects could suffer if we lose \\none or more key personnel or if we are unable to \\nattract and retain our employees. \\nOur business and future growth depend largely on the skills \\nof our workforce, including executive officers and automotive \\ndesigners and engineers.

Our business requires an engaged workforce with \\ncore capabilities in new and emerging skill areas and a \\ncollaborative and innovative culture for our transformation \\nto be successful. If we fail to develop new and flexible skills \\nand capabilities within our workforce, or we fail to hire \\nappropriate talent, our business will lose the ability to remain \\nflexible in a dynamic automotive industry, which is key to \\ndelivering innovative products and services. The loss of the \\nservices of one or more key personnel could impair our ability \\nto implement our business strategy. Any prolonged inability \\nto continue to attract, retain or motivate our workforce \\ncould materially and adversely affect our business, financial \\ncondition, results of operations and prospects. Any shortages \\nof labor could lead to demands for higher wages, which could \\nincrease the labor costs of our business. We may be adversely impacted by terrorism, natural \\ndisasters and epidemics. \\nOur products are exported to a number of geographical \\nmarkets, and we plan to further expand our international \\noperations in the future. Consequently, we are subject to \\nvarious risks associated with conducting our business both \\nwithin and outside our domestic market and our operations in \\nmarkets abroad may be subject to terrorism, natural disasters \\nand extreme weather, fuel shortages and epidemics and \\npandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic). Any disruption \\nof the operations of our manufacturing, design, engineering, \\nsales, corporate and other facilities could materially and \\nadversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition \\nand results of operations. In addition, conducting business \\ninternationally, especially in emerging markets, exposes us \\nto additional risks, including adverse changes in economic \\nand government policies, unpredictable shifts in regulation, \\ninconsistent application of existing laws and regulations, \\nunclear regulatory and taxation systems and divergent \\ncommercial and employment practices and procedures. If \\nany of these events were to occur, there can be no assurance \\nthat we would be able to shift our manufacturing, design, \\nengineering, sales, corporate and other operations to \\nalternative sites in a timely manner, or at all. Any deterioration \\nin international relations, especially between India and \\nits neighboring countries, may result in investor concern \\nregarding regional stability.

Demand is \\ngenerally leaner between April and July and picks up again \\nin the festival season from September to November, with a \\ndecline in December as customers defer purchases to the \\nfollowing year. Further, our rural demand for Commercial \\nVehicles comes largely from agriculture and allied sectors. \\nAny adverse events such as below par monsoon or significant \\nshifts in rainfall patterns could affect consumer sentiment \\nand demand for our vehicles.\\nOur Jaguar Land Rover business is impacted by the biannual \\nregistration of vehicles in the United Kingdom where the \\nvehicle registration number changes every March and \\nSeptember, which leads to an increase in sales during these \\nmonths, and, in turn, impacts the resale value of vehicles. Most \\nother markets, such as the United States, are influenced by \\nthe introduction of new-model-year products, which typically \\noccurs in autumn of each year. Furthermore, in the United \\nStates, there is some seasonality in the purchasing pattern \\nof vehicles in the northern states for Jaguar, where there is \\na concentration of vehicle sales in the spring and summer \\nmonths and for Land Rover, where the trend for purchasing \\n4x4 vehicles is concentrated in the autumn and winter \\nmonths. Markets in China tend to experience higher demand \\nfor vehicles around the Lunar New Year holiday, the National \\nDay holiday and the Golden Week holiday in October. In \\naddition, demand in Western European automotive markets \\ntends to be softer during the summer and winter holidays. \\nJaguar Land Rover’s cash flows are impacted by the seasonal \\nshutdown of all of its manufacturing plants in the United \\nKingdom (including the Engine Manufacturing Center (“EMC”) \\nat Wolverhampton) and Slovakia during the Easter, summer \\nand winter holiday periods. \\nRestrictive covenants in our financing agreements \\ncould limit our operations and financial flexibility \\nand materially and adversely impact our financial \\ncondition, results of operations and prospects. \\nSome of our financing agreements and debt arrangements \\nset limits on and/or require us to, among other matters, obtain \\nlender consent before pledging assets as security. In addition, \\ncertain financial covenants may limit our ability to borrow \\nadditional funds or to incur additional liens. In the past, we have been able to obtain required lender consent for such \\nactivities. However, there can be no assurance that we will be \\nable to obtain such consents in the future. If our liquidity needs \\nor growth plans require such consents and such consents are \\nnot obtained in the future, we may be forced to forego or \\nalter our plans, which could materially and adversely affect \\nour business, prospects, financial condition and results of \\noperations. \\nIn one of our subsidiaries, we could not meet certain \\ncovenants and have obtained the waiver for FY 2021-22 and \\nFY 2022-23.

All new JLR employees in its United Kingdom \\noperations from April 19, 2010, are offered a new defined \\ncontribution pension plan. Under the arrangements with \\nthe trustees of the defined benefit pension schemes, an \\nactuarial valuation of the assets and liabilities of the schemes \\nis undertaken every three years in order to determine cash \\nfunding rates. \\nThe latest statutory valuation as at March 31, 2021 for cash \\nfunding purposes was completed on June 30, 2022.  The \\nvaluations resulted in revised schedules of contributions \\neffective from July 1, 2022.  At the point the valuations were \\nagreed each plan was in surplus, therefore, there are no \\nfurther deficit recover contributions currently payable.  The \\nongoing Group contribution rate for UK defined benefit \\naccrual for FY23 was 24% of pensionable salaries in the UK, \\nhowever following changes in financial conditions, this was \\nreduced to 10 per cent from April 1, 2023.

However, the \\nCompany is still maintaining the pension fund, as an interim \\nmeasure, since the EPFO has still not accepted the transfer of \\npension fund/corpus to its statutory pension fund. Considering \\nthat the EPFO is in the process of providing clarity on various \\nkey elements on the pension scheme, the non-applicability of \\nthe Supreme Court judgement to exempted establishments \\nand the legal advice on status of the exemption, the Company \\nbelieves that no provision is warranted on this matter as of \\nMarch 31, 2023.Jaguar Land Rover has a limited number of \\nmanufacturing, design and engineering facilities \\nand any disruption in the operations of those \\nfacilities could adversely affect our business, \\nfinancial condition or results of operations. \\nJaguar Land Rover has four wholly-owned manufacturing \\nfacilities and two design and engineering centers in the \\nUnited Kingdom, a manufacturing plant in Slovakia, a \\nmanufacturing plant in Brazil and a manufacturing facility in \\nChina, which it owns together with our joint venture partner \\nChery, among other manufacturing locations.

The end of the \\n11-month transitional period following the termination of \\nthe UK’s membership of the European Union on 31 January \\n2020 (the “Brexit Transition Period”) saw the agreement of \\na trade deal between the UK and the EU (the “EU-UK Trade \\nAgreement”). The EU-UK Trade Agreement had provisional \\napplication pending completion of ratification procedures \\nand entered into force on 1 May 2021. \\nThese rules have led to increased border friction between \\nthe UK and EU due to the administrative requirements of \\ncompleting customs documentation which have led to \\nsome increased costs for our business. To continue to qualify \\nfor zero tariff rates, Jaguar Land Rover will need to meet \\nrequirements relating to rules of origin which is not certain to \\nbe possible in the future. For example, the EU's rules of origin, \\nwhich are due to start from 2024, stipulate that 45 percent \\nof an electric vehicle's value must be sourced in the U.K. or \\nelsewhere in Europe to avoid export tariffs of 10 percent. The \\ntariffs would be a burden for automakers building cars in \\nthe U.K. and exporting them to the EU. This, and any other \\nfuture changes to tariffs between the UK and EU, may have \\na material impact upon our ability to access the European \\nmarket. \\nThe Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “IRA”) was passed \\nby the U.S. federal government in August 2022. Among other \\nitems, the IRA allows for purchasers of electric vehicles to \\naccess a consumer tax credit effectively providing a vehicle \\n(i) is assembled in North America; (ii) 50% of the value of the \\nbattery components must be produced or manufactured in \\nNorth America; and (iii) 40% of the value of the critical minerals \\nused for the vehicle must be extracted, processed, and/or \\nrecycled domestically or in a country the United States has a free trade agreement with, with the minimum percentage \\nincreasing annually. EV manufacturing requires a range \\nof minerals, including cobalt, copper, nickel, graphite, and \\nlithium. The consumer tax credits are available on cars up to \\n$55,000 (manufacturer suggested retail price) and $80,000 \\n(manufacturer suggested retail price) for vans, sport utility \\nvehicles and pickup trucks. Access to the consumer tax credit \\nis also subject to income thresholds and other requirements. \\nJLR’s Reimagine strategy sets out a plan for the business to \\nsell an increasing proportion of electric vehicles in the future. \\nAs we presently have no assembly facilities in North America, \\nthis may impact upon our ability to price our electric vehicles \\ncompetitively in the U.S. market in the future. However, we \\ncontinually assess the impact of such regulatory changes on \\nour future business and are developing, and will continue to \\ndevelop, strategies to minimize the potential impact. \\nImposition of any additional taxes and levies designed to \\nlimit the use of automobiles and changes in corporate and \\nother taxation policies, as well as changes in export and other \\nincentives given by various governments or import or tariff \\npolicies, could adversely affect the demand for our vehicles \\nand our results of operations. \\nRegulations in the areas of investments, taxes and levies may \\nalso have a materially adverse impact on Indian securities, \\nincluding the Company’s Shares and ADSs. \\nAny future potential or real unexpected change in law could \\nhave a material adverse effect on our business prospects, \\nresults of operations and financial condition.\\nWe may be affected by competition laws in India \\nand any adverse application or interpretation of \\nthe Competition Act could adversely affect our \\nbusiness. \\nThe Indian Competition Act, 2002 (the “Competition Act”) \\nand various regulations promulgated thereunder, including \\nin relation to merger controls, oversee practices having \\nan appreciable adverse effect on competition in a given \\nrelevant market in India.

TML challenged \\nthe order of the CCI in the Delhi High Court on constitutional \\nissues. In 2019, the High Court allowed the petitions, partly \\nby striking down Section 22(3) of the Competition Act. Also \\nin 2019, the Supreme Court of India extended the relief that \\nwas granted by the Delhi High Court during the pendency of \\nthe matter before it.

The \\ncomplaints include allegations that TML had coerced dealers \\nto avail finance from Tata NBFCs, established a cartel to \\nimpose minimum stock requirements and make available \\nfinancing and violated certain anti-competitive provisions \\nof the Competition Act. In May 2021, the CCI issued an order \\ndirecting the Director General (“DG”) of the CCI to initiate an \\ninvestigation against TML, but did not otherwise make any \\nfinal or binding observations or determinations (including with \\nrespect to any possible penalties or fines) with regard to the \\nallegations.

New or changed laws, \\nrules, regulations and standards may lack specificity and be \\nsubject to varying interpretations. Under applicable Indian \\nlaws, for example, remuneration packages may, in certain \\ncircumstances, require shareholders’ approval. New guidance \\nand revisions may be provided by regulatory and governing \\nbodies, which could result in continuing uncertainty and higher \\ncosts of compliance. We are committed to maintaining high \\nstandards of corporate governance and public disclosure. \\nHowever, our efforts to comply with evolving regulations have \\nresulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased \\ngeneral and administrative expenses and a diversion of \\nmanagement resources and time.

This could have a material \\nadverse effect on our financial results, business prospects, \\nability to obtain financing for capital expenditures and the \\nprice of the Company’s Shares and ADSs. \\nWe may be materially and adversely affected by \\nthe RBI policies and actions. \\nThe Indian stock exchanges are vulnerable to fluctuations \\nbased on changes in monetary policy formulated by the RBI. \\nWe can make no assurance about future market reactions \\nto RBI announcements and their impact on the price of the \\nCompany’s Shares and ADSs. Furthermore, our business \\ncould be significantly impacted were the RBI to make major \\nalterations to monetary or fiscal policy. Certain changes, \\nincluding changes to interest rates, could negatively affect \\nour sales and consequently our Revenue, which could have a \\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial \\ncondition and results of operations. While the RBI has initiated \\nseveral relief measures over the course of 2020, such as \\nproviding moratorium on loans, relaxing provisioning norms \\ntoward certain loans and taking other measures to enhance \\nliquidity for NBFCs, there remains considerable uncertainty \\naround the effects of the recent and any future variants of \\nCOVID-19 and further relief measures and policy actions that \\nmay be needed to assist economic recovery. \\nRights of shareholders under Indian law may \\nbe more limited than under the laws of other \\njurisdictions. \\nThe memorandum and articles of association of the \\nCompany (the “Articles of Association”) and Indian law govern \\nthe Company’s corporate affairs. Legal principles relating \\nto these matters and the validity of corporate procedures, \\ndirectors’ fiduciary duties and liabilities, and shareholders’ \\nrights may differ from those that would apply to a company \\nincorporated in another jurisdiction. Shareholders’ rights \\nunder Indian law may not be as extensive as shareholders’ rights under the laws of other countries or jurisdictions, \\nincluding the United States. You may also have more difficulty \\nin asserting your rights as a shareholder of the Company \\nthan you would as a shareholder of a corporation organized \\nin another jurisdiction. \\nSEBI and the various Indian stock exchanges are responsible \\nfor improving and setting standards for disclosure and other \\nregulatory standards for the Indian securities markets. SEBI has \\nissued regulations and guidelines on disclosure requirements, \\ninsider trading and other matters. Nevertheless, there may \\nbe less information made publicly available in respect of \\nIndian companies than is regularly made available by public \\ncompanies in the United States as a result of differences \\nbetween the level of regulation and monitoring of the Indian \\nsecurities markets and of the transparency of the activities \\nof investors and brokers in India compared to the United \\nStates. The Company’s ADSs have been delisted from the \\nNYSE effective close of trading on the NYSE on January 23, \\n2023. As a consequence of the delisting becoming effective, \\ntermination of the Deposit Agreement under which the ADSs \\nwere issued has also become effective close of trading on the \\nNYSE on January 23, 2023. The said action has no impact on \\nthe current listing status or trading of the Company’s equity \\nshares on the National Stock Exchange of India Ltd. (the \\n“NSE”) and BSE Limited (the “BSE”).

For example, while SEBI has prescribed regulations \\nand guidelines in relation to disclosure requirements, insider \\ndealing and other matters relevant to the Indian securities \\nmarket, there may still be less publicly available information \\nabout Indian companies than for United States domestic \\ncompanies. \\nInvestors may have difficulty enforcing judgments \\nagainst us or our management. \\nThe Company is a public limited company incorporated in \\nIndia. The majority of the Company’s Directors and executive \\nofficers are residents of India and substantially all of the assets \\nof those persons and a substantial portion of the Company’s \\nassets are located in India. As a result, it may not be possible \\nfor you to effect service of process within the United States \\nupon those persons or it may be difficult to effect service of \\nprocess within the United States on the Company. In addition, \\nyou may be unable to enforce judgments obtained in courts \\nof the United States against those persons outside the \\njurisdiction of their residence, including judgments predicated \\nsolely upon U.S. federal securities laws. Moreover, it is unlikely \\nthat a court in India would award damages on the same basis \\nas a foreign court if an action were brought in India to enforce \\nforeign judgments if it viewed the amount of damages as \\nexcessive or inconsistent with public policy. \\nSection 44A of the Indian Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, as \\namended (the “Civil Code”), provides that where a foreign \\njudgment has been rendered by a superior court (within the \\nmeaning of the section) in any country or territory outside India \\nwhich the Government of India has by notification declared \\nto be a reciprocating territory, such foreign judgment may \\nbe enforced in India by proceedings in execution as if the \\njudgment had been rendered by an appropriate court in \\nIndia. However, the enforceability of such judgments is subject \\nto the exceptions set forth in Section 13 of the Civil Code. \\nSection 44A of the Civil Code is applicable only to monetary \\ndecrees not being in the nature of amounts payable in respect \\nof taxes or other charges of a similar nature or in respect \\nof fines or other penalties and does not include arbitration \\nawards. \\nIf a judgment of a foreign court is not enforceable under \\nSection 44A of the Civil Code as described above, it may \\nbe enforced in India only by a suit filed upon the judgment, \\nsubject to Section 13 of the Civil Code and not by proceedings \\nin execution. Accordingly, as the United States has not been \\ndeclared by the Government of India to be a reciprocating \\nterritory for the purposes of Section 44A, a judgment rendered by a court in the United States may not be enforced \\nin India except by way of a suit filed upon the judgment. \\nThe suit must be brought in India within three years from the \\ndate of the judgment in the same manner as any other suit \\nfiled to enforce a civil liability in India. Generally, there are \\nconsiderable delays in the resolution of suits by Indian courts. \\nA party seeking to enforce a foreign judgment in India \\nis required to obtain prior approval from the RBI, under \\nthe Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999 (“FEMA”) \\nto repatriate any amount recovered pursuant to such \\nenforcement. Any judgment in a foreign currency would be \\nconverted into Indian rupees on the date of judgment and not \\non the date of payment. \\nRisks Associated with the Company’s Shares \\nand ADSs \\nFluctuations in the exchange rate between the \\nIndian rupee and the U.S. dollar may have a \\nmaterial adverse effect on the market value of the \\nCompany’s ADSs and Shares, independent of our \\noperating results. \\nOur ADSs have been delisted from the NYSE effective at the \\nclose of trading on January 23, 2023; the price of the ADSs \\nwas quoted in U.S. dollars.

A company's internal financial \\ncontrols with reference to financial statements include those \\npolicies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of \\nrecords that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect \\nthe transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; \\n(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are \\nrecorded as necessary to permit preparation of standalone \\nfinancial statements in accordance with generally accepted \\naccounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures \\nof the company are being made only in accordance \\nwith authorisations of management and directors of the \\ncompany; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding \\nprevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, \\nuse, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a \\nmaterial effect on the standalone financial statements.Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial \\nControls with Reference to Financial \\nStatements\\nBecause of the inherent limitations of internal financial \\ncontrols with reference to financial statements, including the \\npossibility of collusion or improper management override \\nof controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud \\nmay occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any \\nevaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to \\nfinancial statements to future periods are subject to the risk \\nthat the internal financial controls with reference to financial \\nstatements may become inadequate because of changes in \\nconditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies \\nor procedures may deteriorate.\\nFor B S R & Co.

The base case covers the Going \\nConcern Assessment Period and considers the \\nestimated on-going impact of the Russia-Ukraine \\nconflict as well as a cautious view of the impact \\nof near-term supply chain challenges related to \\nglobal semi-conductor shortages. It also accounts \\nfor other end-market and operational factors \\nthroughout the Going Concern Assessment Period. \\nThe base case assumes continued recovery in \\nindustry volumes based upon external industry \\nforecasts. This has been further sensitized using \\nmore severe but plausible scenarios considering \\nexternal market commentaries and other factors \\nimpacting the global economy and automotive \\nindustry. Management do not consider more \\nextreme scenarios than the ones assessed to be \\nplausible.\\n   In evaluating the forecasts, the Company has \\ntaken into consideration both the sufficiency of \\nliquidity to meet obligations as they fall due as well \\nas potential impact on compliance with financial \\ncovenants during the forecast period. These \\nforecasts indicate that, based on cash generated \\nfrom operations, the existing funding facilities and \\ninter corporate deposits from subsidiaries, the \\nCompany will have sufficient liquidity to operate \\nand discharge its liabilities as they become due, \\nwithout breaching any relevant covenants and the \\nneed for any mitigating actions.\\n   Based on the evaluation described above, \\nmanagement believes that the Company has ', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Impairment \\n   At each balance sheet date, the Company \\nassesses whether there is any indication that any \\nproperty, plant and equipment and intangible \\nassets with finite lives may be impaired. If any \\nsuch impairment exists the recoverable amount \\nof an asset is estimated to determine the extent \\nof impairment, if any.

In assessing value in \\nuse, the estimated future cash flows are discounted \\nto their present value using a pre-tax discount rate \\nthat reflects current market assessments of the \\ntime value of money and the risks specific to the \\nasset for which the estimates of future cash flows \\nhave not been adjusted.\\n   If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-\\ngenerating unit) is estimated to be less than its \\ncarrying amount, the carrying amount of the \\nasset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to \\nits recoverable amount. An impairment loss is \\nrecognised immediately in the statement of Profit \\nand Loss.\\n   An asset or cash-generating unit impaired in prior \\nyears is reviewed at each balance sheet date to \\ndetermine whether there is any indication of a \\nreversal of impairment loss recognized in prior \\nyears. i. Recent accounting pronouncements\\n   Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) notifies \\nnew standard or amendments to the existing \\nstandards under Companies (Indian Accounting \\nStandards) Rules as issued from time to time. \\nOn March 31, 2023, MCA issued the Companies \\n(Indian Accounting Standards) Amendment \\nRules, 2023, applicable from April 1, 2023, as \\nbelow: \\n  i.

Leases\\n (a) Accounting policy\\n  Lessee:\\n   At inception of a contract, the Company assesses \\nwhether a contract is, or contain a lease. A contract \\nis, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the \\nright to control the use of an identified asset for a \\nperiod of time in exchange for consideration. To \\nassess whether a contract conveys the right to \\ncontrol the use of an identified asset, the Company \\nassesses whether:\\n\\uf09f The contract involves the use of an identified \\nasset –this may be specified explicitly or implicitly, \\nand should be physically distinct or represent \\nsubstantially all of the capacity of a physically \\ndistinct asset. If the supplier has a substantive \\nsubstation right, then the asset is not identified;\\n\\uf09f The Company has the right to substantially all of \\nthe economic benefits from the use of the asset \\nthroughout the period of use; and\\n\\uf09f The Company has the right to direct the use of \\nthe asset. The Company has this right when it has \\nthe decision making rights that are most relevant \\nto changing how and for what purposes the asset \\nis used. In rare cases where the decision about \\nhow and for what purpose the asset is used is \\npredetermined, the Company has the right to \\ndirect the use of the asset if either:\\n − The Company has the right to operate the \\nasset; or\\n −The Company designed the asset in a \\nway that predetermines how and for what \\npurposes it will be used. \\n   As a practical expedient, Ind AS 116 permits a \\nlessee not to separate non-lease components, and \\ninstead account for any lease and associated non-\\nlease components as a single arrangement. The \\nCompany has not used this practical expedient. \\nAt inception or on reassessment of a contract \\nthat contains a lease component, the Company \\nallocates the consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of their relative \\nstand-alone prices.\\n   The Company recognises a right-of-use asset and \\na lease liability at the lease commencement date. \\nThe right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, \\nwhich comprises of the initial amount of the lease \\nliability adjusted for any lease payments made at \\nor before the commencement date, plus any initial \\ndirect costs incurred and estimated dilapidation \\ncosts, less any lease incentives received. The right-\\nof-use asset is subsequently amortised using the \\nstraight-line method over the shorter of the useful \\nlife of the leased asset or the period of lease. If \\nownership of the leased asset is automatically \\ntransferred at the end of the lease term or the \\nexercise of a purchase option is reflected in the \\nlease payments, the right-of-use asset is amortised \\non a straightline basis over the expected useful life \\nof the leased asset.\\n   The lease liability is initially measured at the \\npresent value of the lease payments that are not \\npaid at commencement date, discounted using, \\nthe Company’s incremental borrowing rate. The \\nlease liability is measured at amortised cost using \\nthe effective interest method. It is re-measured \\nwhen there is a change in future lease payments.\\n   Lease payments include fixed payments, i.e. \\namounts expected to be payable by the Company \\nunder residual value guarantee, the exercise price \\nof a purchase option if the Company is reasonably \\ncertain to exercise that option and payment of \\npenalties for terminating the lease if the lease \\nterm considered reflects that the Company shall \\nexercise termination option. The Company also \\nrecognises a right of use asset which comprises of \\namount of initial measurement of the lease liability, \\nany initial direct cost incurred by the Company and \\nestimated dilapidation costs.\\n   Payment made towards short term leases (leases \\nfor which non-cancellable term is 12 months \\nor lesser) and low value assets (lease of assets \\nworth less than `0.03 crores) are recognised in the \\nstatement of Profit and Loss as rental expenses \\nover the tenor of such leases.', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Whenever the terms \\nof the lease transfer substantially all the risks and \\nrewards of ownership to the lessee, the contract \\nis classified as a finance lease. All other leases are \\nclassified as operating leases.\\n   Amounts due from lessees under finance leases \\nare recognised as receivables at the amount of the \\nCompany’s net investment in the leases. Finance \\nlease income is allocated to accounting periods \\nso as to reflect a constant periodic rate of return \\non the Company’s net investment outstanding in \\nrespect of the leases.\\n   Rental income from operating leases is recognised \\non a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant \\nlease.

Provisions\\n (a) Accounting policy\\n   A provision is recognised if, as a result of a past event, the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation \\nthat can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the \\nobligation. When the effect of the time value of money ismaterial, provisions are determined by discounting the \\nexpected future cash flows using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money \\nand the risks specific to the liability.\\n  Product warranty expenses\\n   The estimated liability for product warranties is recognised when products are sold or when new warranty \\nprogrammes are initiated. These estimates are established using historical information on the nature, frequency and \\naverage cost of warranty claims and management estimates regarding possible future warranty claims, customer \\ngoodwill and recall complaints. The timing of outflows will vary depending on when warranty claim will arise, being \\ntypically up to six years. The Company also has back-to-back contractual arrangement with its suppliers in the \\nevent that a vehicle fault is proven to be a supplier’s fault.\\n   Estimates are made of the expected reimbursement claim based upon historical levels of recoveries from supplier, \\nadjusted for inflation and applied to the population of vehicles under warranty as on Balance Sheet date. Supplier \\nreimbursements are recognised as separate asset.\\n  Provision for onerous obligations\\n   A provision for onerous contracts is recognized when the expected benefits to be derived by the Company from a \\ncontract are lower than the unavoidable costs of meeting its obligations under the contract. It is recognized when \\nthe Company has entered into a binding legal agreement for the purchase of components from suppliers that \\nexceeds the benefits from the expected future use of the components and the Company sells the finished goods \\nusing the components at a loss.', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Revenue recognition\\n (a) Accounting policy\\n  The Company generates revenue principally from-\\n  i)  Sale of products - commercial vehicles and vehicle parts\\n    The Company recognises revenues from sale of products measured at the amount of transaction price (net of \\nvariable consideration), when it satisfies its performance obligation at a point in time which is when products \\nare delivered to dealers or when delivered to a carrier for export sales, which is when control including risks and \\nrewards and title of ownership pass to the customer, and when there are no longer any unfulfilled obligation. \\nThe transaction price of goods sold is net of variable consideration on account of various discounts and schemes \\noffered by the Company as part of the contract.\\n    The Company offers sales incentives in the form of variable marketing expense to customers, which vary \\ndepending on the timing and customer of any subsequent sale of the vehicle. This sales incentive is accounted \\nfor as a revenue reduction and is constrained to a level that is highly probable not to reverse the amount of \\nrevenue recognised when any associated uncertainty is subsequently resolved. The Company estimates the \\nexpected sales incentive by market and considers uncertainties including competitor pricing, ageing of retailer \\nstock and local market conditions.\\n    The consideration received in respect of transport arrangements for delivering of vehicles to the customers are \\nrecognised net of their costs within revenues in the income statement.\\n    Revenues are recognised when collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured.\\n  ii)  Sale of services - maintenance service and extended warranties for commercial vehicles.\\n    Income from sale of maintenance services and extended warranties are recognised as income over the \\nrelevant period of service or extended warranty.\\n    When the Company sells products that are bundled with maintenance service or extended period of warranty, \\nsuch services are treated as a separate performance obligation only if the service or warranty is optional \\nto the customer or includes an additional service component. In such cases, the transaction price allocated \\ntowards such maintenance service or extended period of warranty based on relative standalone selling price \\nand is recognised as a contract liability until the service obligation has been met. The price that is regularly \\ncharged for an item when sold separately is the best evidence of its standalone selling price. In the absence \\nof such evidence, the primary method used to estimate standalone selling price is the expected cost plus a \\nmargin, under which the Company estimates the cost of satisfying the performance obligation and then adds \\nan appropriate margin based on similar services.\\n    The Company operates certain customer loyalty programs under which customer is entitled to reward points \\non the spend towards Company’s products. The reward points earned by customers can be redeemed to claim \\ndiscounts on future purchase of certain products or services. Transaction price allocated towards reward points \\ngranted to customers is recognised as a deferred income liability and transferred to income when customers \\nredeem their reward points.\\n    Sales of services include certain performance obligations that are satisfied over a period of time. Any amount \\nreceived in advance in respect of such performance obligations that are satisfied over a period of time is \\nrecorded as a contract liability and recorded as revenue when service is rendered to customers.\\n   Refund liabilities comprise of obligation towards customers to pay for discounts and sales incentives.', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Financial instruments\\n (a) Accounting policy\\n  (i)  Recognition:\\n    A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or \\nequity instrument of another entity.\\n    Financial instruments are recognised on the balance sheet when the Company becomes a party to the \\ncontractual provisions of the instrument.\\n   Initial measurement\\n    Financial instruments are initially recognised at its fair value. Transaction costs directly attributable to the \\nacquisition or issue of financial instruments are recognised in determining the carrying amount, if it is not \\nclassified as at fair value through profit or loss. However, trade receivables that do not contain a significant \\nfinancing component are measured at transaction price. Transaction costs of financial instruments carried at \\nfair value through profit or loss are expensed in the statement of profit and loss.\\n   Subsequently, financial instruments are measured according to the category in which they are classified.\\n   Classification and measurement – financial assets\\n    Classification of financial assets is based on the business model in which the instruments are held as well as the \\ncharacteristics of their contractual cash flows. The business model is based on management’s intentions and \\npast pattern of transactions. Financial assets with embedded derivatives are considered in their entirety when \\ndetermining whether their cash flows are solely payment of principal and interest. The Company reclassifies \\nfinancial assets when and only when its business model for managing those assets changes.\\n   Financial assets are classified into three categories\\n    Financial assets at amortised cost:  Financial assets having contractual terms that give rise on specified dates \\nto cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal outstanding and that are held \\nwithin a business model whose objective is to hold such assets in order to collect such contractual cash flows \\nare classified in this category. Subsequently, these are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest \\nmethod less any impairment losses.\\n    Equity investments at fair value through other comprehensive income (Equity instruments): These include \\nfinancial assets that are equity instruments and are designated as such upon initial recognition irrevocably. \\nSubsequently, these are measured at fair value and changes therein are recognised directly in other \\ncomprehensive income, net of applicable income taxes.\\n    Dividends from these equity investments are recognised in the statement of Profit and Loss when the right to \\nreceive payment has been established.\\n    When the equity investment is derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss in equity is transferred to retained \\nearnings.\\n    Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (Debt instruments): Financial assets having \\ncontractual terms that give rise on specified dates, to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and \\ninterest on the principal outstanding and that are held within a business model whose objective is to hold such \\nassets in order to collect such contractual cash flows as well as to sell the financial asset, are classified in this ', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets and liabilities at fair \\nvalue through profit and loss are immediately recognised in profit and loss.\\n   Classification and measurement – financial liabilities:\\n    Financial liabilities are classified as measured at amortised cost or FVTPL. A financial liability is classified as \\nat FVTPL if it is classified as held-for-trading, it is a derivative or it is designated as such on initial recognition. \\nFinancial liabilities at FVTPL are measured at fair value and net gains and losses, including any interest expense, \\nare recognised in profit or loss. Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the \\neffective interest method. Interest expense and foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised in profit or \\nloss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is also recognised in profit or loss. \\n    Financial guarantee contracts: These are initially measured at their fair values and, are subsequently measured \\nat the higher of the amount of loss allowance determined or the amount initially recognised less, the cumulative \\namount of income recognised.\\n    Other financial liabilities: These are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.\\n    Equity instruments:  Equity instruments: An equity instrument is any contract that evidences residual interests \\nin the assets of the Company after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Company are \\nrecorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.\\n  (ii) Determination of fair value:\\n    Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction \\nbetween market participants at the measurement date, regardless of whether that price is directly observable \\nor estimated using another valuation technique.\\n    The fair value of a financial instrument on initial recognition is normally the transaction price (fair value of the \\nconsideration given or received).\\n    In estimating the fair value of an asset or liability, the Company takes into account the characteristics of the \\nasset or liability if market participants would take those characteristics into account when pricing the asset or \\nliability at the measurement date.\\n    Subsequent to initial recognition, the Company determines the fair value of financial instruments that are \\nquoted in active markets using the quoted bid prices (financial assets held) or quoted ask prices (financial \\nliabilities held) and using valuation techniques for other instruments. Valuation techniques include discounted \\ncash flow method and other valuation methods.\\n  (iii) Derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities:\\n    The Company derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset \\nexpires or it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to \\nanother entity.

Any gain or loss arising on derecognition is \\nrecognised in profit or loss.

In this case, any cumulative gain or loss in equity is transferred to retained \\nearnings. Financial assets are written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery. The Company \\nreviews the facts and circumstances around each asset before making a determination. Financial assets that \\nare written off could still be subject to enforcement activities.\\n    Financial liabilities are decrecognised when these are extinguished, that is when the obligation is discharged, \\ncancelled or has expired.\\n  (iv) Impairment of financial assets:\\n    The Company recognises a loss allowance for expected credit losses on a financial asset that is at amortised \\ncost or at fair value through other comprehensive income.

The Company designates these forward \\ncontracts in a cash flow hedging relationship by applying the hedge accounting principles. The Company also \\nuses interest rate swaps to hedge its variability in cash flows from interest payments arising from floating rate \\nliabilities i.e. when interests are paid according to benchmark market interest rates.\\n    Derivatives are initially measured at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition, derivatives are measured at \\nfair value, and changes therein are generally recognised in profit or loss.\\n    At inception of the hedge relationship, the Company documents the economic relationship between the \\nhedging instrument and the hedged item, including whether changes in the cash flows of the hedging \\ninstrument are expected to offset changes in the cash flows of the hedged item. The Company documents its \\nrisk management objective and strategy for undertaking its hedging transactions. The Company designates \\nonly the intrinsic value of foreign exchange options in the hedging relationship. The Company designates \\namounts excluding foreign currency basis spread in the hedging relationship for both foreign exchange \\nforward contracts and cross- currency interest rate swaps. Changes in the fair value of the derivative contracts \\nthat are designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows are recognised in the cash flow hedge reserve \\nwithin other comprehensive income (net of tax), and any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the \\nstatement of profit and loss.\\n    Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified to the statement of Profit and Loss in the periods in which the \\nforecasted transactions occurs.\\n    For forwards and options, forward premium and the time value are not considered part of the hedge.

Also, the interest rates on some types of assets and \\nliabilities may fluctuate with changes in market interest rates, while interest rates on other types of assets \\nmay change with a lag.\\n     The risk estimates provided assume a parallel shift of 100 basis points interest rate across all yield curves. \\nThis calculation also assumes that the change occurs at the balance sheet date and has been calculated \\nbased on risk exposures outstanding as at that date.

Also, projections of any \\nevaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to \\nfinancial statements to future periods are subject to the risk \\nthat the internal financial controls with reference to financial \\nstatements may become inadequate because of changes in \\nconditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies \\nor procedures may deteriorate.\\nOther Matters\\nOur aforesaid report under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act on \\nthe adequacy and operating effectiveness of the internal \\nfinancial controls with reference to financial statements/\\nfinancial information insofar as it relates to two subsidiary \\ncompanies, two step-down subsidiaries and one joint \\noperation company, which are companies incorporated in \\nIndia, is based on the corresponding reports of the auditors \\nof such companies incorporated in India.\\nThe internal financial controls with reference to financial \\nstatements/financial information insofar as it relates to two \\nsubsidiary companies, two associate companies and two \\njoint venture companies, which are companies incorporated \\nin India and included in these consolidated financial \\nstatements, have not been audited either by us or by other \\nauditors.

The definition of a change in \\naccounting estimates has been replaced with \\na definition of accounting estimates. Under \\nthe new definition, accounting estimates are \\n“monetary amounts in financial statements \\nthat are subject to measurement uncertainty”. \\nEntities develop accounting estimates if \\naccounting policies require items in financial \\nstatements to be measured in a way that \\ninvolves measurement uncertainty.\\n   The Company is assessing the impact of these \\nchanges and will accordingly incorporate the same \\nin the financial statements for the year ending \\nMarch 31, 2024.', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Leases\\n (A) Accounting policy\\n  Lessee:\\n   At inception of a contract, the Company assesses whether a contract is, or contain a lease. A contract is,or contains, \\na lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for \\nconsideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, the Company \\nassesses whether:\\n\\uf09f The contract involves the use of an identified asset – this may be specified explicitly or implicitly, and should be \\nphysically distinct or represent substantially all of the capacity of a physically distinct asset. If the supplier has a \\nsubstantive substation right, then the asset is not identified;\\n\\uf09f The Company has the right to substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of the asset throughout the \\nperiod of use; and\\n\\uf09f The Company has the right to direct the use of the asset. The Company has this right when it has the decision \\nmaking rights that are most relevant to changing how and for what purposes the asset is used.\\n\\uf09f In rare cases where the decision about how and for what purpose the asset is used is predetermined, the Company \\nhas the right to direct the use of the asset if either:\\n − The Company has the right to operate the asset; or\\n − The Company designed the asset in a way that predetermines how and for what purposes it will be used.\\n   As a practical expedient, Ind AS 116 permits a lessee not to separate non-lease components, and instead account for \\nany lease and associated non-lease components as a single arrangement. The Company has not used this practical \\nexpedient. At inception or on reassessment of a contract that contains a lease component, the Company allocates \\nthe consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of their relative stand-alone prices.\\n   The Company recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The right-of-\\nuse asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises of the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any \\nlease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and estimated \\ndilapidation costs, less any lease incentives received. The right-of-use asset is subsequently amortised using the \\nstraight-line method over the shorter of the useful life of the leased asset or the period of lease. If ownership of \\nthe leased asset is automatically transferred at the end of the lease term or the exercise of a purchase option is \\nreflected in the lease payments, the right-of-use asset is amortised on a straightline basis over the expected useful \\nlife of the leased asset.\\n   The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at commencement \\ndate, discounted using, the Company’s incremental borrowing rate. The lease liability is measured at amortised \\ncost using the effective interest method. It is re measured when there is a change in future lease payments. The \\nCompany has elected not to recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases that have a \\nlease term of 12 months or less and leases of low value assets (lease of assets worth less than ` 0.03 crores) . The \\nCompany associates the lease payments associated with these leases as an expense on a straight line basis over \\nthe lease term.\\n   Lease payments include fixed payments, i.e. amounts expected to be payable by the Company under residual value \\nguarantee, the exercise price of a purchase option if the Company is reasonably certain to exercise that option ', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The Company also recognises a right of use asset which comprises of amount of initial \\nmeasurement of the lease liability, any initial direct cost incurred by the Company and estimated dilapidation costs.\\n  Lessor:\\n   At the inception of a lease, the lease arrangement is classified as either a finance lease or an operating lease, based \\non contractual terms & substance of the lease arrangement. Whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially \\nall the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee, the contract is classified as a finance lease. All other leases are \\nclassified as operating leases.\\n   Amounts due from lessees under finance leases are recognised as receivables at the amount of the Company’s net \\ninvestment in the leases. Finance lease income is allocated to accounting periods so as to reflect a constant periodic \\nrate of return on the Company’s net investment outstanding in respect of the leases.\\n   Rental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease. Initial \\ndirect costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the \\nleased asset and recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\\n (B)  The Company leases a number of buildings, plant and equipment, IT hardware and software assets, certain of which \\nhave a renewal and/or purchase option in the normal course of the business. Extension and termination options are \\nincluded in a number of leases across the Company. The majority of extension and termination options held are \\nexercisable only by the Company and not by the respective lessor. The Company assesses at lease commencement \\nwhether it is reasonably certain to exercise the extension or termination option. The Company re-assesses whether \\nit is reasonably certain to exercise options if there is a significant event or significant change in circumstances within \\nits control. It is recognised that there is potential for lease term assumptions to change in the future and this will \\ncontinue to be monitored by the Company where relevant.

Impairment assessment of Jaguar Land Rover Business\\n  The operations of subsidiary Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), excluding equity accounted investments, represents a single cash-\\ngenerating unit (“CGU”). This is because of the closely connected nature of the cash flows and the degree of integrated \\ndevelopment and manufacturing activities.\\n  In accordance with accounting standard, management have performed an impairment assessment as at January 31, \\n2023. The date of the assessment was changed from that of the prior year (March 31, 2022) to better align with the \\nbusiness plan cycle.\\n  The impairment assessment determined that the CGU recoverable value exceeded the carrying amount by ` 15,246.72 \\ncrores (£1,500 million) (2022: `5,965.40 crores (£600 million) and therefore no impairment was identified. The increase \\nin headroom has largely been driven by the improved performance experienced in the latter part of the year. It was \\nfurther determined that this increase did not require the reversal of the previously recorded impairment loss as the \\nunderlying drivers for the increased headroom do not reflect a change in the assumptions used when the impairment \\nwas recognised.\\n  JLR has considered it appropriate to undertake the impairment assessment with reference to the approved business \\nplan that was in effect as at the assessment date. The business plan includes a five-year cash flow forecast and contains \\ngrowth rates that are primarily a function of the JLR’s Cycle Plan assumptions, historic performance and management’s \\nexpectation of future market developments through to 2027/28.\\n  In estimating the future cash flows management have given due consideration to the inherent uncertainty of forecast \\ninformation and have adjusted some of the assumptions in the business plan to take into account possible variations in \\nthe amount or timing of the cashflows. In doing so, management has incorporated the following risks into the VIU, as well \\nas other risks that may impact future cash flows.\\n →execution risks associated with our ‘Reimagine’ strategy and the transition to electrified powertrain, with the supporting \\ntransformation plan ‘Refocus 2.0’, which includes a dedicated environmental sustainability strategy – ‘Planet Regenerate’\\n →near-term supply chain challenges related to global chip shortages which has continued to impact JLR in FY23: and \\n →economical and geopolitical factors increasing inflationary pressures, driving up material costs in particular. \\n  Climate risk - JLR recognises that the potential impact of climate risk to areas such as supply chain, operations, and \\nmaterial and compliance costs may result in variations to the timing and amounts of future cash flows. As such climate \\nrisk is incorporated into the development of our forecast cash flows in the VIU by reference to our climate change risk \\nassessment. These risks are principally reflected by the risk adjustments related to the variable profit and volumes which \\nwould be most affected by climate change events, for example, scarcity of certain commodities driving up costs and \\ntherefore adversely impacting variable profit.\\n Key assumptions\\n  The assessment of impairment is based on forecasts of future cashflows which are inherently uncertain and are \\ndeveloped using informed assumptions such as historical trends and market information. The key assumptions are:\\n (i)  the recoverable amount is most sensitive;\\n (ii)  involve a significant amount of judgement and estimation; and\\n (iii)  drive significant changes to the recoverable amount when flexed under reasonably possible outcomes.', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

A small change in either assumption \\nmay have a significant impact to future cashflows and for this reason, as well as the impact of risks associated with \\nsupply and inflationary pressures on variable profit and volumes, JLR consider variable profit per unit and volumes to be \\nkey assumptions. Further, the variable profit per unit and volumes included in the business plan are largely driven by an \\nupdated portfolio, which includes estimates and judgements related to the transition to electrified powertrain, including \\nthe introduction of new Jaguar.\\n  Terminal value capital expenditure – the five year cash flows timing and amount are based on the latest Cycle Plan. The \\nterminal value is based on the best estimate of a maintenance level of capital expenditure which has been derived from \\ndepreciation and amortisation expectations and funding requirements in responses to longer-term industry trends and \\nrisks informed by those listed above, which are anticipated in the VIU calculation. Due to the judgement and estimation \\ninvolved in the calculation of terminal value capital expenditure, as well as the sensitivity of the recoverable amount to \\nany change in the value, JLR consider this to be a key assumption. \\n  Discount rate – the approach to determining the discount rate is based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model and a market \\nparticipant after tax cost of debt. These inputs are based on a typical build up approach, calculated using country \\nspecific premiums without size premium and with an unlevered equity Beta with reference to industry peers. The discount \\nrate is regarded as a key assumption as it is the rate which drives the discounted cashflows used to determine the VIU of \\nthe CGU primarily due to the level of judgement and estimation involved and the sensitivity of the recoverable amount to \\nsmall changes in the percentage. \\n  The VIU assessment is sensitive to certain assumptions, such as Sales, General & Administration (“SG&A”) costs, due to the \\nrelative total value but involve limited judgement and estimation, and significant changes are not considered reasonably \\npossible, and therefore are not considered to be key assumptions. Similarly, certain assumptions which involve greater \\njudgement and estimation, such as growth rate, but for which even relatively significant changes have a limited impact \\non the assessment are not regarded as key assumptions. \\n Sensitivity to Key Assumptions\\n The value of key assumptions used to calculate the recoverable amount are as follows:\\nAs at   \\nMarch 31, 2023As at   \\nMarch 31, 2022\\nPre-tax discount rate 15.6% 13.4%\\nTerminal value variable profit (%GVR)* 23.9% 24.8%\\nTerminal value capital expenditures (%GVR) 8.3% 10.0%\\n* Based on forecast variable profit per unit and volumes\\n Sensitivity to reasonably possible changes to key assumptions\\n  Given the inherent uncertainty about the timing and amount of any change in key assumptions, as well as the significant \\nportion of the recoverable amount related to the VIU terminal value, JLR consider a net impact on terminal period cash \\nflows to be the best means of indicating the sensitivity of key assumptions.\\n  JLR considers the variable profit and volumes assumptions to be interdependent as movement in one assumption will \\nimpact the other, impacting the overall variable profit. For example, the profit optimisation efforts discussed above will \\nlikely result in higher average variable profit per unit with lower volumes whereas a focus on volumes would likely see \\na reduction in the average variable profit per unit. Consequently, the terminal value variable profit sensitivity below \\nincorporates sensitivity in volumes via the impact on variable profit.', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Income taxes\\n (A) Accounting Policy\\n   Income tax expense comprises current and deferred taxes. Income tax expense is recognised in the consolidated \\nstatement of profit and loss except when they relate to items that are recognised outside of profit or loss (whether \\nin other comprehensive income or directly in equity), in which case tax is also recognised outside profit or loss, or \\nwhere they arise from the initial accounting for a business combination. In the case of a business combination the \\ntax effect is included in the accounting for the business combination. Current income taxes are determined based \\non respective taxable income of each taxable entity.\\n   Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for the future tax consequences of temporary differences \\nbetween the carrying values of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and unutilised business loss and \\ndepreciation carry-forwards and tax credits. Such deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed separately for \\neach taxable entity and for each taxable jurisdiction. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent it is probable \\nthat future taxable income will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, unused tax losses, \\ndepreciation carry forwards and unused tax credits could be utilised. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets \\nis reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable \\nprofits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.\\n   Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured based on the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period \\nwhen the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or \\nsubstantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Current and deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when \\nthere is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate \\nto income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Company intends to settle its current tax assets and \\nliabilities on a net basis. The extent to which deferred tax assets can be recognised is based on an assessment of \\nthe probability that future taxable income will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and \\ntax loss carry-forwards can be utilised. \\n   Deferred tax liabilities on taxable temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries, branches and \\nassociated companies and interests in joint arrangements are not recognised if the Company is able to control the \\ntiming of the reversal and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The UK Finance Act 2016 was enacted during the year ended March 31, 2017, which included provisions for a reduction in the UK corporation tax \\nrate to 17% with effect from April 1, 2020. Subsequently a change to the main UK corporation tax rate, announced in 2020, was substantively \\nenacted as at March 31, 2020. The rate applicable from April 1, 2020 now remains at 19% rather than previously enacted reduction to 17%. \\nA further change to the main UK corporation tax rate from 19 to 25 percent with effect from 1 April 2023 was announced in the Budget on 3 \\nMarch 2021, and was substantively enacted on 24 May 2021.\\n  Accordingly, JLR UK deferred tax has been provided at a rate of 25% on assets (2022: 25%) and 25% on liabilities (2022: 25%), recognising the \\napplicable tax rate at the point when the timing difference is expected to reverse.\\n2.  The Company has opted for the New Tax Regime inserted by section 115BAA of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (“Act”) and enacted by the Taxation \\nLaws (Amendment) Ordinance, 2019 (\"the Ordinance\") which is applicable from Financial year beginning April 1, 2019.

During the year ended March 31, 2023, the Company recognised Deferred Tax Assets on previously unrecognised unused unabsorbed \\ndepreciation and long term capital losses incurred in the current year based on the probability of sufficient taxable profit in future periods, \\nmostly those arising from planned divestments which will yield capital gains against which such unabsorbed depreciation and capital loss will \\nbe set off.

Provisions\\n (A) Accounting Policy\\n   A provision is recognised if, as a result of a past event, the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation \\nthat can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the \\nobligation. When the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the \\nexpected future cash flows using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money \\nand the risks specific to the liability.\\n  Product warranty expenses\\n   The estimated liability for product warranties are recognized when products are sold or when new warranty \\nprogrammes are initiated. These estimates are established using historical information on the nature, frequency \\nand average cost of warranty claims and management estimates regarding possible future warranty claims, \\ncustomer goodwill and recall complaints The timing of outflows will vary depending on when warranty claim will \\narise, being typically up to six years and for batteries in Electric Vehicles warranty period is typically up to eight years. \\nThe Company also has back-to-back contractual arrangement with its suppliers in the event that a vehicle fault is \\nproven to be a supplier’s fault.\\n   Estimates are made of the expected reimbursement claim based upon historical levels of recoveries from supplier, \\nadjusted for inflation and applied to the population of vehicles under warranty as on balance sheet date. Supplier \\nreimbursements are recognised as a separate asset.\\n  Provision for onerous obligations\\n   A provision for onerous contracts is recognized when the expected benefits to be derived by the Company from a \\ncontract are lower than the unavoidable costs of meeting its obligations under the contract. It is recognized when \\nthe Company has entered into a binding legal agreement for the purchase of components from suppliers that \\nexceeds the benefits from the expected future use of the components and the Company sells the finished goods \\nusing the components at a loss.\\n  Residual risk\\n   In certain markets, the Company is responsible for the residual risk arising on vehicles sold by dealers under leasing \\narrangements. The provision is based on the latest available market expectations of future residual value trends. \\nThe timing of the outflows will be at the end of the lease arrangements being typically up to three years.\\n  Legal and product liability\\n   Legal and product liability provision is recorded in respect of compliance with regulations and known litigations which \\nimpact the Company. The product liability claim primarily relates to motor accident claims, consumer complaints, \\ndealer terminations, personal injury claims and compliance with emission and battery disposal regulations.\\n   The timing of outflows will vary depending on when claims are received and settled, which is not known with \\ncertainty. The assumptions made, especially the assumption about the outcome of legal proceedings, are subject \\nto a high degree of uncertainty. The appropriateness of assumptions is regularly reviewed, based on assessments \\nundertaken both by management and external experts, such as lawyers. If new developments arise in the future \\nthat result in a different assessment, provisions are adjusted accordingly.', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Revenue from Operations \\n\\t (A)\\t Accounting\\tPolicy\\t\\n  The Company generates revenue principally from – \\n  a)   Sale of products – (i) commercial and passenger vehicles and vehicle parts and (ii) Sales of other products - \\ncertain software products and other automotive products\\n    The Company recognises revenues from sale of products measured at the amount of transaction price (net of \\nvariable consideration), when it satisfies its performance obligation at a point in time which is when products \\nare delivered to dealers or when delivered to a carrier for export sales, which is when control including risks and \\nrewards and title of ownership pass to the customer, and when there are no longer any unfulfilled obligation. \\nThe transaction price of goods sold is net of variable consideration on account of various discounts and schemes \\noffered by the Company as part of the contract.\\n     The Company offers sales incentives in the form of variable marketing expense to customers, which vary \\ndepending on the timing and customer of any subsequent sale of the vehicle. This sales incentive is accounted \\nfor as a revenue reduction and is constrained to a level that is highly probable not to reverse the amount of \\nrevenue recognised when any associated uncertainty is subsequently resolved. The Company estimates the \\nexpected sales incentive by market and considers uncertainties including competitor pricing, ageing of retailer \\nstock and local market conditions.\\n    Revenue is recognised on a bill-and-hold basis where vehicles, for example, are sold to the customer but are \\nretained in the Company’s possession at a vehicle holding compound on behalf of the customer ahead of \\nbeing physically transferred to them at a future time. In such arrangements it is ensured that the customer has \\nobtained the ultimate control of the product.\\n    There are certain vehicles which are being given to the customers along with operations and maintenance \\nof the same. These are considered as finance leases and accordingly, revenue is recognised at the lease \\ncommencement date at fair value of the leased asset. The cost of sales is reduced for the present value \\nof unguaranteed residual values. In addition, initial direct costs are recognised as cost of sales at the lease \\ncommencement date. \\n    The consideration received in respect of transport arrangements for delivering of vehicles to the customers are \\nrecognised net of their costs within revenues in the income statement.\\n   Revenues are recognised when collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured.\\n  b)   Sale of services - maintenance service, telematics features and extended warranties for commercial and \\npassenger vehicles, software support services and insurance broking services.\\n    Income from sale of maintenance services, telematics features and extended warranties, including software \\nservices are recognized as income over the relevant period of service or extended warranty. \\n    When the Company sells products that are bundled with maintenance service or extended period of warranty, \\nsuch services are treated as a separate performance obligation only if the service or warranty is optional \\nto the customer or includes an additional service component. In such cases, the transaction price allocated \\ntowards such maintenance service or extended period of warranty based on relative standalone selling price \\nand is recognised as a contract liability until the service obligation has been met. The price that is regularly \\ncharged for an item when sold separately is the best evidence of its standalone selling price. In the absence \\nof such evidence, the primary method used to estimate standalone selling price is the expected cost plus a ', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The defined \\nbenefit plans hold a significant proportion of equity type assets, which are expected to outperform corporate bonds \\nin the long-term while providing volatility and risk in the short-term.\\n   As the plans mature, the Company intends to reduce the level of investment risk by investing more in assets that \\nbetter match the liabilities. \\n   However, the Company believes that due to the long-term nature of the plan liabilities and the strength of the \\nsupporting group, a level of continuing equity type investments is an appropriate element of the Company’s long \\nterm strategy to manage the plans efficiently.\\n  Changes in bond yields\\n   A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase plan liabilities, although this is expected to be partially offset by an \\nincrease in the value of the plans’ bond holdings and interest rate hedging instruments.\\n  Inflation risk\\n   Some of the Company's pension obligations are linked to inflation, and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities \\n(although, in most cases, caps on the level of inflationary increases are in place to protect the plan against high \\ninflation). The plans hold a significant proportion of assets in index linked gilts, together with other inflation hedging \\ninstruments and also assets which are more closely correlated with inflation. However an increase in inflation will also \\nincrease the deficit to some degree.\\n  Life expectancy\\n   The majority of the plan’s obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy \\nwill result in an increase in the plan’s liabilities. This is particularly significant in the UK defined benefit plans, where \\ninflationary increases result in higher sensitivity to changes in life expectancy.\", start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Financial instruments  \\n (A) Accounting Policy  \\n  (i)  Recognition   \\n    A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability \\nor equity instrument of another entity. Financial instruments are recognised on the balance sheet when the \\nCompany becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument\\n   Initial measurement  \\n    Financial instruments are initially recognised at its fair value. Transaction costs directly attributable to the \\nacquisition or issue of financial instruments are recognised in determining the carrying amount, if it is not \\nclassified as at fair value through profit or loss. However, trade receivables that do not contain a significant \\nfinancing component are measured at transaction price. Transaction costs of financial instruments carried at \\nfair value through profit or loss are expensed in profit or loss\\n    Subsequently, financial instruments are measured according to the category in which they are \\nclassified.  \\n   Classification and measurement – financial assets \\n    Classification of financial assets is based on the business model in which the instruments are held as well as the \\ncharacteristics of their contractual cash flows. The business model is based on management’s intentions and \\npast pattern of transactions. Financial assets with embedded derivatives are considered in their entirety when \\ndetermining whether their cash flows are solely payment of principal and interest. The Company reclassifies \\nfinancial assets when and only when its business model for managing those assets changes. \\n   Financial assets are classified into three categories \\n    Financial assets at amortised cost:  Financial assets having contractual terms that give rise on specified dates \\nto cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal outstanding and that are held \\nwithin a business model whose objective is to hold such assets in order to collect such contractual cash flows \\nare classified in this category. Subsequently, these are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest \\nmethod less any impairment losses. \\n    Equity investments at fair value through other comprehensive income (Equity instruments): These include \\nfinancial assets that are equity instruments and are designated as such upon initial recognition irrevocably. \\nSubsequently, these are measured at fair value and changes therein are recognised directly in other \\ncomprehensive income, net of applicable income taxes.

If the Company neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership \\nand continues to control the transferred asset, the Company recognises its retained interest in the asset and an \\nassociated liability for amounts it may have to pay. If the Company retains substantially all the risks and rewards \\nof ownership of a transferred financial asset, the Company continues to recognise the financial asset and also \\nrecognises a collateralised borrowing for the proceeds received. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition is \\nrecognised in profit or loss. When a financial instrument is derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss in equity is \\ntransferred to the statement of profit and loss unless it was an equity instrument electively held at fair value through \\nother comprehensive income. In this case, any cumulative gain or loss in equity is transferred to retained earnings. \\nFinancial assets are written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery.
